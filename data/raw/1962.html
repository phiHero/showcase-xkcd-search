<p>This comic is making fun of the various names we give "generations" while also predicting some future names. The release of this comic coincides with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin/">Pew Research Center's recent announcement that they have decided where the Millennial generation ends</a>.
</p><p>Each generation listed is exactly 18 years long, which is the approximate length of each "generation" anyway (given that coincidentally, there are exactly 54 intermediate years between the end of World War II and the New Millennium). A number of the entries are parodies of the terms "Generation X," "Generation Y," etc., by substituting other letters or characters that would seem emblematic of the time period.

</td>
<td> ƒ was used to represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Long s">"long s"</a> in the typography used in Colonial America.  It can be seen in many historical documents from the period.  It is also the symbol that represented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dutch guilder">guilder</a>, the currency of the Netherlands from the 17th century until 2002. It has a notable similarity to letter "esh" ʃ. Depicted symbol is also used in mathematical expressions as in <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="f(x)" src="/wiki/images/math/5/0/b/50bbd36e1fd2333108437a2ca378be62.png" />.

<td> Generation Æ
</td>
<td> 1784 - 1801
</td>
<td> Æ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Æ">diphthong</a> Aesh - its name sounds like X, though it is pronounced as a long e or IPA /æ/.  This character is commonly transcribed differently into British English and American English as ae and e respectively making a difference in spelling in words such as encyclopaedia/encylopedia.  One of the key influences on this is Webster's dictionary, first published 1828.

</td>
<td> 1802 - 1819
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was born in 1809, and is regarded as one of the best presidents of all time. The comic states that the other people born in this generation were "cut a lot of slack" because of him. As with the Oops, one of us is Hitler generation, it is absurd to define an entire generation by defining its most famous member.

</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Generation_(Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_theory)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gilded Generation (Strauss–Howe theory)"> So named under the Strauss-Howe generation theory</a>, though they use the time period 1822-1842 instead.  This likely refers to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gilded Age">Gilded Age</a>" of American history, roughly the last three decades of the 19th century.

<td> The Second-Greatest Generation
</td>
<td> 1838 - 1855
</td>
<td>
<p>This is a reference to the Greatest Generation, below, and could be implying a similarity between the accomplishments and sacrifices of this generation - who fought in the U.S. Civil War and who passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution - to those of the Greatest Generation. There is also some humor in the name: what Randall means is that this generation was, supposedly, second best in terms of its greatness. However, the wording could be interpreted to mean that they are chronologically the second generation to be called "greatest", even though they actually were born first.

<td> 1856 - 1873
</td>
<td> – • • – is the letter X in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Morse code">International Morse Code</a>. This is an old-timey version of Gen Xers, mirrored by the later "More Gen-Xers somehow." This is also a reference to the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Telegraphy">telegraphy</a>, popular during this time period.

</td>
<td> 1874 - 1891
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour#The_Industrial_Revolution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Child labour">Child labor</a> had been widely used since before the start of the Industrial Revolution, but this is when people started doing something about it - and also, when the need for an educated workforce arose, applying substantial economic pressure on societies to put children in school instead.  It would be more accurate to label this generation, "The kids who stopped dying in the Gilded Generation's factories and mines".
</td></tr>

<td> Oops, one of us is Hitler
</td>
<td> 1892 - 1909
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, possibly the most hated (and, by most definitions, evil) man in living human memory as of this comic's posting, was born during in 1889.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>  Aside from the fact that this places him in the previous generation, it seems beyond silly to blame everyone else who was born during this period for being born in the same generation as him.  Among those who eventually heard of him (thus, excluding those in isolated areas or who died before he rose to power), the vast majority of them would not hear of him until well after 1909. In reality, this generation is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Generation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lost Generation">Lost Generation</a>, though the dates are somewhat skewed.
</td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The Silent Generation
</td>
<td> 1928 - 1945
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Baby Boomers
</td>
<td> 1946 - 1963
</td>
<td> A spike in births was seen following the return of soldiers to the US from European and Pacific theatres of war.  These children enjoyed the benefits of US prosperity whilst the rest of the world rebuilt, lived in fear of nuclear annihilation and watched the Space Race.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Generation X
</td>
<td> 1964 - 1981
</td>
<td>  "X" here refers to an unknown or undefined element, not specifically a placement in the alphabet as Y and Z (see below) seem to imply, and was used throughout history to refer to alienated youth in general as early as the 1950s, with the name sticking to this one thanks to Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel. Generation X's time period was one of sweeping societal change and rapid technological advancement.
</td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Generation 💅 (nail polish emoji)
</td>
<td> 2000 - 2017
</td>
<td> This begins the hypothetical future generation names, though this generation was already fully born as of this comic's posting.  Social media was established and rising during the formative years of this generation, and the widespread adoption of emoji began during this time. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://emojipedia.org/nail-polish/">Nail Polish Emoji</a> (U+1F485) is used here. Currently known in reality as Generation Z or iGen (there's controversy over both names, but the goods and bads of each seem to cancel each other out and other names aren't as exciting) though the comic implies it may change due to emojis ultimately replacing the alphabet entirely.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Zuckerberg's Army
</td>
<td> 2018 - 2035
</td>
<td> Continuing on the above, this may be presuming the dominance of Facebook during the childhoods of this generation, and corresponding social norming as ultimately directed by its leader Mark Zuckerberg.  Ironically, as of this comic's posting, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-quit-young-people-social-media-snapchat-instagram-emarketer-a8206486.html">young users were already leaving Facebook for other social media sites</a>. May also be a reference to "Dumbledore's Army" in <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>.  It is uncertain whether Zuckerberg's Army is in alliance or at war with the other social media militaries of the mid-21st century.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The Hovering Ones
</td>
<td> 2036 - 2053
</td>
<td> This may posit increased adoption of cybernetics, which (as with any technology) are more easily adopted by the young who do not have to unlearn previous ways.  If advances allowed someone to hover all the time, such that one would not need to walk, this generation's name suggests that becoming so widely used among this generation that they became known for it.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Spare Parts
</td>
<td> 2054 - 2071
</td>
<td> Continuing on the above speculation about cybernetics, this presumes enough apathy or sociopathy among this generation's parents that giving birth (or other means of creating a new human) was often done to create bodies from which organs could be harvested (presumably primarily for the benefit of their elders).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> More Gen-Xers somehow
</td>
<td> 2072 - 2089
</td>
<td> As with "Generation – • • –", this may be positing that Generation X like traits pop up about 3/4 of the way through each century.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The Paperclip Machines
</td>
<td> 2090 - 2107
</td>
<td> This, and the alt text, are references to the concept of a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip maximizer</a>, where an AI might be designed to be helpful, but end up being harmful.  The clicker game <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal Paperclips</a> makes this concept playable.  Furthering the above speculation of cybernetics, this generation might be primarily artificial intelligences, though of limited ability to set their own priorities (a flaw which would be fixed in later generations).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The Mixed Bag (produced 4 Lincolns, 1 Napoleon, and 2 Hitlers)
</td>
<td> 2108 - 2125
</td>
<td> As with the above examples, a generation may become known for its most famous members, but it is not useful to define an entire generation by them. In this case, the generation may have literally produced 4 Lincolns, 1 Napoleon, and 2 Hitlers via cloning or the like. This also implies that Napoleon's generation was named after him. However, Napoleon's generation is ironically, the Adequate Generation.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The Procedural Generation
</td>
<td> 2126 - 2143
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Procedural generation">Procedural generation</a> is a way of creating data automatically, rather than capturing it via sensor (including when the "sensor" is a keyboard and the data is typed in).  This confusion of the term "generation" could refer to more artificial intelligences that were created via routines instead of directly coded, which would likely stem from attempts to improve child creation once most children were explicitly manufactured instead of relying on evolution-granted biological means.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Generation Ω
</td>
<td> 2144 - 2161
</td>
<td> "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Omega">Omega</a>" is the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and used as a symbol of endings.  Given the above generation names implying increasingly artificial children, this may suggest the last generation that is recognizably a generation.  This does not necessarily mean the end of children or the end of humanity, just that anything after 2161 is widely recognized to no longer have even notional generational coherence - perhaps because of drift (children born to one group during a given time are wildly different enough from children born to another group at the same time that people give up trying to group them by time), child gestation and maturation times (for example, if it became common for a child to go from conception to adulthood in less than a year), or exceptions to what counts as a "child" (for example, if it becomes possible and common to create clones that are somewhere between free-willed beings and mind-controlled drones, and this sufficiently supplants creation of completely free-willed children, regardless of whether the children are artificial intelligences or old-fashioned biological children).

<dl><dd>I think I found it: 💅  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://emojipedia.org/nail-polish/">"nail-polish"</a> (Comes up very different on different systems) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233">162.158.79.233</a> 21:20, 2 March 2018 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Couldn't this emoji, and hence the title "Generation 💅", refer to the rise of nail care salons or manicure salons during the recent years? I don't know about other countries, but at least in certain parts of Europe, Germany in particular, there seems to be such a boom of this kind of establishments that I often wonder how they survive and open even more such businesses, even though it appears there's more nail salons than (manicured) nails in town. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Passerby&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Passerby (page does not exist)">Passerby</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Passerby&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Passerby (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:56, 4 March 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I have to believe the 1748 - 1765  generation is some form of "Long s" such as U+1E9C or U+1E9D <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233">162.158.79.233</a> 21:12, 2 March 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd> It looks more like a forte (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1d191/index.htm">U+1D191</a>). I'm not sure why that would be funny—maybe because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fortepiano" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:fortepiano">fortepianos</a>? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.69.214" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.69.214">172.69.69.214</a> 21:43, 2 March 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>My position comes from the fact that documents written by this generation (i.e. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s#/media/File:Long-s-US-Bill-of-Rights.jpg">Declaration of Independance</a> and the US Constitution) are noted for having this letter form. The script form of the long s looks like what Randall has written, which, to your point, looks like a "forte" <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.233">162.158.79.233</a> 22:51, 2 March 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Actually, it quite clearly is <b>not</b> long s.  Long s only has the tic on the left side of the main stroke, not on both sides as is the case here. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.78.118" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.78.118">162.158.78.118</a> 22:24, 3 March 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd> I read it as an italic lower-case F, <i>f</i>, as used to denote <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Function_(mathematics)">mathematical functions</a>. I think it looks more like one of those than a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Long_s">long s</a>, ſ, though I don't have an explanation for why that would be used to name a generation. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Smylers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Smylers (page does not exist)">Smylers</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Smylers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Smylers (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:50, 5 March 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Year 2378 may be explained by last episode of Voyager happening that year, but no idea about year 2360. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 00:59, 3 March 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Year 2360 is when the humans who became adults (18) in 2378 were born. This time-span is probably when the majority of human TNG characters would have been born (not necessarily notable ones). This is similar to how people born in 1982 became the first new adults in the new millenium. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.46.143" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.46.143">172.68.46.143</a> 05:02, 3 March 2018 (UTC)

<p>Filled in most of the table with explanations (I'm pretty sure most of the latter generation names are references to potential transhumanist futures), but I'm not sure what "Second-Greatest" Generation refers to unless it's about the Civil War.  Also, I'm not entirely certain whether the generation before the gilded one was cut a lot of slack.  And I'll let someone more versed in standard sociological history fill in the common reasons for the core 20th century generations.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:WingedCat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:WingedCat (page does not exist)">WingedCat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:WingedCat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:WingedCat (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:49, 2 March 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Ω</dt></dl>
<p>Wow that’s a lot of speculation on the Ω generation! 177 words of it! Who knew people could imagine so much inspired by a single character (and no historical context to extrapolate from). Personally, I tend to think of it as the “resistance generation” given my electronic background 😜. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">PotatoGod</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:11, 4 March 2018 (UTC)

</p><p>Millennials were *originally* called "Echo Boomers" (after the Baby Boomers, and because most of them are that generation's kids), "Generation Y" came later but before "Millennials" stuck as a non-snowclone name. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.63.100" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.63.100">162.158.63.100</a> 01:56, 18 June 2018 (UTC)
</p><p>Generation X being the tenth generation of Americans seems a bit of a stretch. A generation is generally 35 years, and seems unlikely to be less than 20. And <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X#Origin_of_term">Douglas Coupland</a>, who coined this use of the term, used "X" as lazy shorthand for alienation and a rejection of societal norms.
