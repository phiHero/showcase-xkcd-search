<p>This was the ninth <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:April_fools%27_comics" title="Category:April fools&#39; comics">April fools' comic</a> released by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>. The previous fools comic was <a href="/wiki/index.php/1975:_Right_Click" title="1975: Right Click">1975: Right Click</a> from Sunday April 1, 2018. The next became <a href="/wiki/index.php/2288:_Collector%27s_Edition" title="2288: Collector&#39;s Edition">2288: Collector's Edition</a>, which was delayed two days and released on Friday April 3, 2020.
</p><p>The interactive comic began at noon ET (16:00 UTC) on April 1, 2019, and ended a day later. In it, users were shown two emojis and voted for their favorite before the time ran out. 512 different emojis were paired against each other in a cup or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bracket (tournament)">bracket</a> system, with only one winner. See more below under <a href="#How_it_worked">How it worked</a>.
</p><p>Brackets - like the one in this comic, for finding the best emoji - are a recurring theme in xkcd. It is also relevant for this time of year, and two years ago in 2017, the first comic in April, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1819:_Sweet_16" title="1819: Sweet 16">1819: Sweet 16</a> from April 3rd was a bracket, referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Madness" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:March Madness">March Madness</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2019 NCAA Division I Men&#39;s Basketball Tournament">2019 version</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:National Collegiate Athletic Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:College basketball">College basketball</a> national championship tournament began March 19th and ends April 8th 2019. So this comic could also be said to reference this, although it is not so explicit here. Earlier Randall made another large and "silly" bracket in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1529:_Bracket" title="1529: Bracket">1529: Bracket</a> (which someone then actually made into an online voting system, just like in this comic).
</p><p>The title is a reference to the movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome">Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</a>,</i> which had the tagline:  "Two men enter. One man leaves." The "Thunderdome" in the film is a gladiatorial arena where conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death.
</p><p>In the final round, the Milky Way emoji (🌌) won against the Hedgehog emoji (🦔). The comic was updated to show the result.
</p><p>Clicking the comic links to a bracket of 128 emojis showing the winners: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2131/emojidome_bracket_round_of_128.png">https://xkcd.com/2131/emojidome_bracket_round_of_128.png</a>

<p>In the first round, the voting period for each bout lasted 37.5 seconds. The voting period for each bout doubled for the second, third, and fourth rounds. The voting period for each bout for the fifth round through the end was 26 minutes. The entire bracket took 24 hours 6 minutes. 
</p><p>Remaining time of a given bout was shown on a timer beneath the voting buttons. If the time remaining was one minute or greater, the time was shown rounded to the nearest minute (e.g., "Remaining Time: 26 minutes"); thus the minute would change on the half minute (e.g., "2 minutes" changed to "1 minute" at 1 minute 30 seconds). If the time remaining was less than a minute, the time was shown in seconds (e.g., "59 seconds"). When there were two (sometimes three) seconds remaining, the timer would display "Time's Up!" through the end of the bout and for a <a href="/wiki/index.php/1070:_Words_for_Small_Sets" title="1070: Words for Small Sets">couple</a> of seconds after the end of the bout while the images for the next bout were loading. Then the next bout would appear and the results of the previous bout would be added to the list of past bouts, with the most recent bout at the top.
</p><p>Commentary was displayed above the images for each bout, and changed occasionally through the bout. In the first round, the commentary was made up of some stock phrases with a few custom phrases mixed in. Later commentary was tailored to suit each match-up and provided live updates on how each bout was progressing. A final comment was included in the list of past bouts.

<p>The competing candidates were periodically overlaid with colored hearts that floated up from the vote button oscillating in a triangle wave pattern before disappearing above the candidate. Below the current competition, the results of past bouts were shown with the "loser" displayed in greyscale, the winner in color, and the final robot-commentator comment on that match.
</p><p>The commentary appeared to suggest that there was some real-time feedback from the results of the competition. For instance, "It seems like our friends over Australia is joining the fun" appeared in the commentary. So did "We are getting a lot of questions on this today. This is live commentary, folks."  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/8kPwjou.png">https://i.imgur.com/8kPwjou.png</a>, directly declaring that the commentary is live. 
</p><p>Note that the schedule might show different emoji pictures than the main voting screen, presumably because of fonts. The image is pre-rendered.
</p><p>The competing candidates are chosen in order of Unicode value at first, resulting in similar emojis being compared. Examples include:
</p><p>😜 squaring off against 😛 - two emojis playfully sticking their tongues out
</p><p>🤩 squaring off against 😍 - two smiling emojis with symbols for eyes
</p><p>😂 squaring off with 🤣 - two emojis that are crying in laughter/joy.
</p><p>The original title text "🤼🤼🤼🤼🤼🤼🤼🤼" consisted of eight wrestler emojis. This likely represented the round of 8, where the eight winners then can turn to the winner next to them and continue the quarterfinals, etc. The title text was updated after the final round.
</p><p>Notably, it appears the eggplant emoji (🍆) and the peach emoji (🍑) were left out of the bracket, alongside the middle finger emoji (🖕). The eggplant and peach are frequently used to represent a penis and vulva, respectively. There has been no statement from Randall on why they were left out.
</p><p>A robot face announcer-emoji (🤖) and a link to the full bracket was added at 38 minutes in.

The round 3 bracket was later updated with results during the Volcano vs Owl fight. There was an error where the flying saucer had beaten the stars, which was not the case.
A new bracket image was created for the Round of 32 which seems to be updated with new results as they come in. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.xkcd.com/2131/emojidome_bracket_round_of_32.png">https://www.xkcd.com/2131/emojidome_bracket_round_of_32.png</a>
</p><p>It is not clear how the winner is decided when both emojis tied for first. This has happened twice: in Cupcake vs. Birthday Cake (🧁 vs. 🎂) with 3658 points each, where the Birthday Cake (🎂) was declared winner, and in the very first match of Grinning Face vs. Grinning Face With Smiling Eyes (😀 vs. 😁), in which no votes were cast, but the Grinning Face With Smiling Eyes (😁) was declared winner. Both of these tied bouts occurred in round 1, and both declared winners lost their subsequent match in round 2.

But the dynamic part of the comic as well as the "error image" displayed to services that could not render the dynamic comic is also transcribed here below.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The final picture shows the winner of the gold medal in the Emojidome bracket tournament, as well as the runner up with the silver medal. There is no text. The winner is the "Space", "Stars" or "Milky Way" emoji, which is shown with a blue band on top of a dark blue band on top of an almost black background, indicating the light band of the Milky Way in the night sky. Stars (in both five point star shape and as dots) in light blue are spread out in all three bands of color. The large gold medal with its red neck string, is floating close to the middle of the picture, lacking any kind of neck in space to tie it around. To the left of the gold medal is the runner up, the brown Hedgehog, with light-brown face. It clutches the smaller silver medal, also with red neck string, which floats out there in space. The hedgehog with medal is depicted small enough to fit inside the neck string on the gold medal.]</dd></dl>

<dd><a href="/wiki/index.php/File:2131_Emojidome_example.png" class="image"><img alt="2131 Emojidome example.png" src="/wiki/images/thumb/f/f1/2131_Emojidome_example.png/400px-2131_Emojidome_example.png" width="400" height="270" srcset="/wiki/images/thumb/f/f1/2131_Emojidome_example.png/600px-2131_Emojidome_example.png 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/f/f1/2131_Emojidome_example.png/800px-2131_Emojidome_example.png 2x" /></a></dd>
<dd>[At the top center of the comic, the two emojis battling it out are shown next to each other. The emojis displayed in the comic used the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji">twemoji</a> icon set. A different emoji set was shown in links to image of the tournament brackets. These matches are called bouts in the comic. The emoji from the top (or left) of the bracket is shown to the left. In this case it was space, night sky, milky way or stars vs Maglev train. Between them is the following text:]</dd>
<dd>VS</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[There are two buttons one below each of the two emoji. If pressed the buttons became red. They could be pressed multiple times each match. The buttons have text on them:]</dd>
<dd>Vote Vote</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[From the buttons colored hearts are released, often in bundles, and then they wave up across the emoji who's button they emanated from.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Below the buttons there is and indicator showing how long the current battle is open for further votes. In the example the text is:]</dd>
<dd>Remaining time: 24 minutes</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The time began at "26 minutes" during the final rounds. It changed to "1 minute", with 1 minutes and 30 seconds left, and then 30 seconds later to "60 seconds" counting down to a few seconds. Then, before reaching 2 or 3 seconds it changed (a bit too early) to "Time's up!" Shortly there after a new bout would begin.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Above the two emoji at the very top is a comment. The commentator is shown as a robot emoji. The comment often changed during the long final rounds. In the current example the text is:]</dd>
<dd>"~future~"</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[But there would have been several others during the match. Given that Space won the entire Emojidome, the train lost this match. Often a final comment was posted just as the result was in. These final messages was then put at the top of the list of past bouts (matches). These bouts was displayed at the bottom of the comic below the remaining time. To the left was the following text:]</dd>
<dd>Past bouts:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Below this text was a list of all previous matches, showing the two emojis, with the loser grayed out, with their final comment next to them. As soon as there where more than three a scroll bar appeared to the right, making it possible to scroll down through all these previous matches. As it was 512 emojis to begin with, there were 256 bouts in the first round, and then 255 the rest of the way to the final for a total of 511 bouts at the end. Here are the the text of the three matches that can be seen in the example (the grayed out loser was Sushi, Bee and Wizard):]</dd>
<dd>🌋 vs 🍣 "Sushi has received a technical disqualification for being very very cooked"</dd>
<dd>🐝 vs 🦉 "Owls well that ends well"</dd>
<dd>🦔 vs 🧙 "The Wizard didn't do it"</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[All the final bouts remarks, as well as the match ups, the score of votes, and all the other comments coming at the top during each bout can be found below in the round 1 to round 9 sections. They are thus not only a transcript.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Finally at the bottom of the comic below the scroll-able version of the past bouts, there was a link to images of the brackets, beginning with the full long one of all 512 emojis, and the zooming in and out, plus updating with results along the way. The link was a text that explained what the link was for. In the current example the link text, which is link blue, was:]</dd>
<dd>Full bracket for today's comic (round 3).</dd></dl>

</p><p>There is a websocket connection. A message is sent every time you vote. It looks like there are also status update messages every second (saying which emoji currently has exactly how many votes, i suspect this changes the amount of hearts that show up), and "bracket start" messages every so often. The bracket start message seems to contain hundreds of upcoming emoji pairs. Edit: a bracket start is sent at the start of every match (so every ~30 seconds). It also contains logs of which messages to show for previous matches, and which emoji are currently battling.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.138.10" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.138.10">172.69.138.10</a> 16:30, 1 April 2019 (UTC)

<p>Well this is fun. Look like there are 512 symbols, meaning 256 first-round contests. The first round would take (at 38 seconds / round) ~2.7 hours.

<p>While some of the recaps of past battles are generic (taco vs sandwich: "One for the history books"), many seem to be specifically written for the battle (light bulb vs candle: "Some would argue that this one was settled in the 1800s"). I wonder if/how much this will continue into round 2.

<dd>It looks like it's 1:14/round, which is double what the time was in round one. Will round three be 2:28? 1:51?
<dl><dd>It's just over 1:15/round from the history JSON (plus some hundredths of a second, but it appears 1:15 is the intent)
<dl><dd>Hadn't looked there. Round one concluded at 18:39:20-ish, 9560 seconds from 16:00:00. At 256 battles, that's 37.34 seconds/battle.

<dd>2 minutes 30 seconds per battle now. Looks like each round will be 2 hours 40 minutes long.</dd>

<dl><dd> It seems that Randall is commentating this live, as he periodically says it's live in the robot commentator text. See above. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.189.241" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.189.241">172.68.189.241</a> 19:36, 1 April 2019 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Perhaps not "live" as each round 2 matchup was known 160 minutes before it was voted on. He could comment on the battle itself, and/or provide a comment if one or the other combatant won. I think he's a couple hours ahead of us.
<dl><dd> I dunno. Whenever a new battle starts, there is a default message, that is soon replaced by a more pertinent message. That seems to suggest that he's doing it on the fly. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:9yz" title="User:9yz">9yz</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:9yz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:9yz (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:03, 1 April 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Just because it <i>says</i> it's live, doesn't mean that it really is.  It's also possible that the actual clicks are being ignored and the reported numbers are all pre-generated.

<p>Is Birthday Cake vs. Cupcake the draw referenced at the end of the "How it worked" section? Can we please have names added to all the emoji in the explanation text; I have never found a way to blow up emoji to a visible size, so frequently find I can't see them clearly enough to identify them, and in that bit at the end of "How it worked", the first one isn't rendering on my computer anyway. I'm guessing that the other is the birthday cake; really, I have come to hate emoji because they are so tiny.

</p><p>I had assumed that the "score" was a not simple count of vote clicks - I'd imagine (especially with all the autoclicking etc) that the raw votes would be gigantic numbers.

I could be totally off-base, but that seems vaguely suspicious to me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.214.82" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.214.82">162.158.214.82</a> 05:28, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I concur: that is highly suspicious. Fortunately, nothing of importance is at stake here, even if you were really pulling for the octopus.

<dd> A similar thing happened for the "scared cat vs devil" bout - those two were consistently nearly tied until about T-10 minutes, whereupon the devil voting rate spiked and devil finished ~12000 votes ahead. The "cat vs hedgehog" bout was also similar - hedgehog had a consistent lead of ~1000 votes until about T-10 minutes, when the hedgehog voting rates spiked and hedgehog ended up finishing ~10000 votes ahead.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.214.28" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.214.28">162.158.214.28</a> 14:39, 2 April 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I'm no expert at all, but it there any way that the websites that shows the number of votes live etc. can test whether these votes are real, or something Randall has pre-programmed? Not that I would not believe he was willing to stay up for the duration of this day, but it is an April Fools' Day comic, so he is completely "allowed" to have decided him self who should win all matched and have made up the commentaries in advance. Yes it would take along time, but not longer than doing it on the fly. It could just be that joke on us, that our votes does nothing and we just see how Randall has decided the dome should end. Can anyone go in to this, and explain why it is as it is either way (for sure made up, for sure real or uncertain if real or fake)? (PS I dislike these sections in the commentaries, but there are already 6...) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 12:27, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
