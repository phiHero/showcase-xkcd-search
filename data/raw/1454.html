<p>This comic is a joke about the hyperbolic expression <i>shut it down</i> being taken literally. If someone thinks that a device has achieved its goal they shut it down. After an idea or product that people think is well made is created people will joke that the process that created it should be shut down, as if the process has achieved its ultimate purpose. This is most often used sarcastically for an inferior product or idea. Taking things literally is a common theme in the xkcd comics.
</p><p>Curly-hair sits at a computer anxiously and nervously writing a message to someone she cares about deeply, possibly a child to be adopted or a romantic interest. Curly-hair plans on saving enough money to have the person flown to her location from "half a world away." Curly-hair ends the message with a promise to communicate daily until the two are able to meet. When attempting to send the message, however, Curly-hair discovers that their internet connection is down and the message goes unsent.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> explains there was a "ridiculous video" to which someone had commented "That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done." This was taken literally and, because enough people agreed with this comment, the internet was shut down and Curly-hair was left unable to communicate with her love.
</p><p>The joke being that the internet was creating something far more valuable between Curly-hair and her love than a ridiculous video, thus highlighting the beautiful and far reaching potential impact of the internet. The likelihood of the entire internet being shut down based on a single comment being vanishingly low adds to the humor.
</p><p>In the final panel Curly-hair states wistfully that she was not done with the internet. The title text is Ponytail's response, which asserts Ponytail's belief that Curly-hair's message could not be important because the Facebook comment asserted that nothing of any significance could come from the internet after the ridiculous video.

<dl><dd> The country is not spoken to in the comic and therefore should be left out, regardless of where people think it is placed. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209">108.162.216.209</a> 22:25, 2 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I think it's a girl, and I think she's in the United States, as xkcd is a US-based comic, and pony-tail is a recurring figure also presumably in the United States. And I think it's all rather sad. Note that she's kneeling on her chair, not sitting - this is more common for girls than guys. My take is that she's the kind of person who can enter into a fantasy relationship with a person she doesn't really know, and then if/when they do ever meet in real life it will all break down because her fantasy is only that, and the real person will not match her expectations at all. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:RenniePet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RenniePet (page does not exist)">RenniePet</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:RenniePet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:RenniePet (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:37, 1 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I look at that she was incredibly lucky - it's a classic internet relationship scam. Maybe I'm just a cynic. There's also the phrase <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/do-over">"Done Over"</a>, although I think it's a British idiom, so I highly doubt it was meant as a double entendre. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Oobayly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Oobayly (page does not exist)">Oobayly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Oobayly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Oobayly (page does not exist)">talk</a>)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Yeah, note that she's going to be saving up money for six months, thus that'll likely be a sizeable sum.  And the person that she "connected" with is a half a world away, always a bad sign as no real evidence of identity is truly possible at that distance, and as an internet user, likely in the us, half a world away may well be a country where the reimbursed cost of a plane ticket is worth the work of fabricating &amp; upkeeping a fake idealized relationship in order to get the eventual reward of that money.  The cynic in me gives this a 50% chance that this is a classic scam. - Kzqai  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.27" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.27">108.162.216.27</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.216.27&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.216.27 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Why is the sex relevant, although I believe it is a girl by hair and posture (comics use stereotypes to convey information with a few details. I do not think it changes the meaning of the comic. If it the gender is debated remove it.  Although I do think that it is clear that the character is female.

<dl><dd>I'm not so sure... it would seem it was primarily funny cat videos, the funniest possible of which was obviously posted, viewed, and judged as the final necessary use of the internet. It was thus agreed to shut it down, as there is really no need to continue with this charade variously coined as "commerce", "science", or other superfluous forms of so-called "communication" (that is the garbled blathering that is not funny cat pictures or videos), all depending of course on your preferred (but nonetheless obviously deluded) persuasion.

<p>This could be far more than a romantic involvement. She says she thought she was asking too much. But then she found... a like-minded individual, someone who can... notice the 'glitches in the matrix', as it were.

<p>You guys are all missing the point (except for the "die happy" commenter). Sometimes, when watching such an impressive video, people say something along the lines of "the internet is over" to mean "that video was so impressive that no one will ever top it. We might as well shut down the internet." This comic takes that expression literally, and shuts down the internet in the middle of someone's important conversation. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Diszy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Diszy (page does not exist)">Diszy</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Diszy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Diszy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:08, 1 December 2014 (UTC)

</p><p>At first I thought it was a romance kinda thing, but it would also be an appropriate/situation in case of adoption. Maybe she found her reason to live in an orphan across the globe (I presume in a poor country). That she will be able to fly him/her here in six months she will be able to support the kid. This is also supposing that all paperwork will be finished in 6 months (which I think it's quite fast for adoption, but then again, we don't know how long they have been communicating for).  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.215.102" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.215.102">108.162.215.102</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.215.102&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.215.102 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd>Absolutely not. It would be HIGHLY inappropriate in the case of a child. "I had started to think I was asking too much, that I needed to settle. And then I found you." When you have a relationship, if you think it is not good enough you can break up and look for someone else. When you cannot find anyone better, you have to settle for what you can get. But you can NOT take that attitude -- "if it doesn't work out we can send it back to the factory" -- towards having (or adopting) a child! That would be literally inhuman, like the mother's attitude at the end of "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.38.40" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.38.40">162.158.38.40</a> 21:59, 4 March 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>As the argument over the sex of the subject of this comic rages on (hyperbole), I remembered that when I checked xkcd.com on Lynx, there were transcripts of every comic. I looked again and it seems that it does not do this for new comics. Does anyone know who writes those transcripts? If, for example, next week the transcript on the official website refers to the character as a girl, could that be used as a source? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Maplestrip" title="User:Maplestrip">Maplestrip</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Maplestrip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Maplestrip (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:41, 2 December 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>Given that the Internet shutdown was spontaneous, and alternate communication/news sources probably hadn't been set up yet to the degree needed, how does the second character know what happened? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Z&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Z (page does not exist)">Z</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Z&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Z (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:05, 2 December 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Everyone agreed to shut down ith internet.  There would be a time delay from the time the comment was posted and people agreed to shut it down, during this time the majority of internet users would find out. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209">108.162.216.209</a> 22:25, 2 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>I think the comments about "we're done" are off the mark.  I took the situation to be an exasperated developer and maintainer of network resources saying "we created the internet to be an amazing tool for communication and development of high human endeavors, but it has degenerated into a trivial exercise in watching hokey clips about cute animals.  That's it!  We've had it!  No more!  Shut 'er down!"

<dl><dd>I agree completely.  I have never heard the expression used to describe shut it down because the job is done but I have heard this wording used repeatedly in conversation when referring to something they were exasperated with.  Also, this interpretation of the above seems more likely since it is a fairly common comment/joke, where as this would be the first time I would have heard someone joke that the purpose of the internet was to get ridiculous videos.  If she had said a cat video, my perspective would, of course, be different.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.133.41" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.133.41">199.27.133.41</a> 02:40, 8 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>This comic made me sad&#160;:( <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.223.35" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.223.35">108.162.223.35</a> 07:04, 9 December 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>I think the description completely misses the point.  The key phrase in the dialogue is "Why can't I connect?".  She is referring to her Internet connection, but what she should be asking herself is why she can't connect with people.  Apparently, there is no one close to her she can connect with so she needs to look halfway around the world.  The comic is mocking curly hair and painting her in a pathetic light.  I'm still struggling to figure out what "Done" means.  Maybe it means we should turn off the Internet so we connect with the people around us instead of chatting with strangers we've never met half way around the world.  The Facebook comment in the title text might be supporting this.  Stop commenting on random things on the Internet and talk to the people around you. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.125" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.125">173.245.52.125</a> 18:16, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>And the irony is that I am making this comment to people half way around the world right now.&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.125" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.125">173.245.52.125</a> 18:41, 10 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The facebook comment -- you may think you can still use the internet for something, but we know it's a crock so we know that you, like everyone else, have nothing useful to do with it any more. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.38.40" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.38.40">162.158.38.40</a> 21:59, 4 March 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>But she <i>can</i> connect with other people. The whole comic demonstrated this. If you specifically mean people around her, there's no evidence that she can't do that, either. We don't know her social life. We just know that this particular relationship is currently over the internet (though she doesn't plan to keep it that way). And there's nothing unusual, pathetic, or mockable about that, nor any particular reason to think that the comic is deriding her for it. Lots of people go through several relationships before finding "the one". And sometimes people meet "the one" in another country. Not finding your true love among the people in your immediate area is not some kind of personal failing, nor a sign that one "can't connect". <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NoriMori&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NoriMori (page does not exist)">NoriMori</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NoriMori&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NoriMori (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:06, 10 August 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I, personally, have often seen the "The internet is done, shut it down." comments on humorous or clever posts on tumblr; that interpretation is what I got out of the comic, as the description says. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.77" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.77">108.162.216.77</a> 22:30, 27 December 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Same. It's a bit baffling to me how much confusion and over-thinking that part is causing. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NoriMori&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NoriMori (page does not exist)">NoriMori</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NoriMori&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NoriMori (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:06, 10 August 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>When reading the beginning of this comic, I assumed that the joke would be that the writer is <i>not</i> writing to a beloved person, but to a consumer product. Talk of needing to settle, finding something half a world away, saving for six months... I thought they were talking wistfully to the new Mac they planned to order; or a vehicle. The idea that it was actually a person-to-person love interest &amp; not a joke, did not occur to me until the end of the comic presented itself &amp; no such gag was evident. Even so, I think the comic works fine even if you imagine them writing longingly to an expensive carbon-frame bicycle or an especially fine wine subscription.
