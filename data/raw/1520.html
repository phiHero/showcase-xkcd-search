<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> (physics), a grown-up <a href="/wiki/index.php/Science_Girl" title="Science Girl">Science Girl</a> (biology), and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> (chemistry) appear to be on a talk show called Degree-Off, hosted by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairy" title="Hairy">Hairy</a>, where representatives of different fields, try to explain why their field is the best and why to get a degree in their field. The title "Degree-Off" is a portmanteau of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Academic degree">degree</a>", as in the recognized completion of studies at a school or university,  and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Face-off">face-off</a>", a direct confrontation between two people or groups. Since there are three participants, this is not a true face-off, unless Megan, who does not speak, is not counted.
</p><p>The host asks the physicist Cueball to go first. He light-heartedly begins to tell what appears to be long story, beginning with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> anecdote. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> in Los Alamos, Richard Feynman got bored because of the isolation and started learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lock picking">lock picking</a> on the secret documents safes. Using these new skills, he played lots of pranks on his colleagues, like leaving notes and spooking them into believing there was a spy among them (which, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Fuchs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Klaus Fuchs">there was</a>). He finishes his case with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford">a quote</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, implying that his speech was quite long and winding. The quote communicates the idea that physics is the only fundamental framework, so that the job of chemists, biologists and other scientist simply is to catalog and systematize observations ("collect stamps") on phenomena too complicated to presently be fully described in terms of physics. This idea was earlier lampooned by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> in <a href="/wiki/index.php/435:_Purity" title="435: Purity">435: Purity</a> (and is also stated in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1158:_Rubber_Sheet" title="1158: Rubber Sheet">1158: Rubber Sheet</a>).
</p><p>The biologist goes next, showing with a graph (see below) that the field of biology has helped reduce disease. She then goes on to claim that the heroes in biology (the part known as Medicine) have even "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Eradication of infectious diseases">slain</a>" one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>. Different traditions designate the Four Horsemen differently, but it is common for their number to include Plague or Pestilence.  Science Girl claims that the field of biology has eliminated widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse#As_infectious_disease" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse">Pestilence</a> - at the time of writing it was not readily apparent that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:COVID-19 pandemic">the old dog still has some teeth</a>. The imagery of Pestilence being thwarted by modern medicine was also used in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Good Omens">Good Omens</a>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> (of whom Randall is a fan, see <a href="/wiki/index.php/1498:_Terry_Pratchett" title="1498: Terry Pratchett">1498: Terry Pratchett</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Neil Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, where Pestilence has retired after the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Penicillin">Penicillin</a>, and been replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pollution">Pollution</a>.
</p><p>The graph shows the death rate from infectious disease in the USA with the range of 1900-2000. The spike is attributable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:1918 flu pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a>. It has been published in the paper <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=768249">Trends in Infectious Disease Mortality in the United States During the 20th Century</a>.
</p><p>Science Girl then goes on to directly accuse Cueball (i.e. physicists) of creating a new Horseman to replace the one slain by the biologists. She refers to the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a>, which was built and tested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_desert" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:New Mexico desert">New Mexico desert</a>. The new horseman is therefore the atomic bomb, or the various perils associated with it.
</p><p>Science Girl's implied condemnation of the physics community has been echoed by some of the scientists involved in the project itself. After the test detonation of the first nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:J. Robert Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, found himself quoting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bhagavad Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
</p><p>This harsh moral judgement shocks Cueball, who exclaims "I thought this was supposed to be fun and lighthearted!" While the set-up is of a frivolous friendly competition, Science Girl's presentation is surprisingly dark. Her retort in the final panel reveals that she was angered by the off-hand dismissal of 'soft' sciences as "stamp-collecting", and turned the game from a light-hearted fun into something more serious.
</p><p>In the title text the biologist goes on to declare in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:All caps">All caps</a> that she is surprised a physicist isn't "harder", after all their condescending towards the "squishy" sciences. The use of 'hard' and 'squishy' is a play on the colloquial division between the so-called 'hard' sciences (such as physics and chemistry) and 'soft' sciences (such as biology and geology). 'Hard' sciences usually refer to the perception that in fields like physics, precisely repeatable experiments and measurements are possible, as opposed to 'soft' sciences seen as placing less emphasis on precisely quantifiable predictability - however Science Girl is extending 'hard' to its meaning of 'stoic', mocking Cueball for not being able to weather a personal moral attack. Again she is indicating that she's upset by directly referencing a mocking portrayal of other fields allegedly made by Cueball.
</p><p>To be fair to Cueball, the outbreak of disease is more a topic for epidemiology, and biology has spawned multiple diseases, atrocities, and bad movies. However, the Manhattan Project marked the first time in history that humanity possessed the ability to destroy itself - and shortly thereafter humanity got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cold War">perilously close to doing so</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/index.php/520:_Cuttlefish" title="520: Cuttlefish">520: Cuttlefish</a> Randall shows that he personally respects biologists - or at least fears them.
</p><p>Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, this one was the first of these the second, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1539:_Planning" title="1539: Planning">1539: Planning</a>, came out just 1½ month after this one and after that these two were released early in 2016: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1626:_Judgment_Day" title="1626: Judgment Day">1626: Judgment Day</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1655:_Doomsday_Clock" title="1655: Doomsday Clock">1655: Doomsday Clock</a>. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/Thing_Explainer" title="Thing Explainer">Thing Explainer</a></i>, specifically they are explained in the explanation for <i>Machine for burning cities</i> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Thermonuclear weapon">thermonuclear bombs</a>, but they are also mentioned in <i>Boat that goes under the sea</i> about a submarine that carries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how insane it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life).

<dl><dd>Yes your are splitting hair. Because in xkcd most characters are just generic and can be any person they need to be. The characteristic of the hair bun has been used only a few times, 8 with this one. Sometimes the figure even represents a real person.

Since Randall is a big fan of Terry Pratchett it is very likely that he refers to "his" version of the four Horsemen. (It is not Terry's invention, but he made it popular amongst people like Randall). As I disagree with the Death version of the title text, I'm not sure that Terry is directly refereed to in this comic, but I'm sure the Bilologist refers to them killing of pestilence (or plauge). --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 17:23, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

<p>The discussion about the new horseman of the apocalypse being radiation poisoning, and the linking of it all to Pratchet, reads very very strangely, I think it is a major overreach. It's very common for Pestilence to be listed as one of the four horsemen, and even with Randall being a Terry Pratchett fan, it seems unlikely this had any influence on it. It's stock-standard in pop culture for them to be listed as War, Famine, Death, Pestilence, even if they don't appear that way in the Bible, just as it is stock-standard for the devil to be portrayed as a red horned guy with cloven feet (which also doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible). It seems like the development of the atomic bomb is what Hair Bun Girl is referring to as the new horseman. I don't see why an overly specific and convoluted connection to "radiation poisoning" is included. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.249.170" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.249.170">108.162.249.170</a> 08:08, 8 May 2015 (UTC)

That's not science girl's usual hairstyle, and science girl is a child. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Sensorfire" title="User:Sensorfire">Sensorfire</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Sensorfire" title="User talk:Sensorfire">talk</a>) 18:03, 26 October 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Is the girl representing chemistry Science Girl?</dt></dl>
<p>It doesn't seem to be Science Girl to me. I think Hairbun would be better used. Also related, I think Science Girl should be renamed Jill, as per [1662: Jack and Jill] <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Sensorfire" title="User:Sensorfire">Sensorfire</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Sensorfire" title="User talk:Sensorfire">talk</a>) 18:42, 1 November 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Took me a while to figure out the numbers, (I'm here 'cause I'm dumb, right). [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/03/infectious-disease-deaths-decline-across-us-not-evenly">UMN says that by 2017</a>], infectious diseases were "down to 34.10 deaths per 100,000 persons." All causes put together are around 1,000 per 100,000. Anyway, after doing the numbers 3 times, by June 19 2020, depending your source, Covid-19 deaths are up to 120 K in the US. Which translates roughly to 36.55 per 100,000? Meaning, deaths by infectious diseases MORE THAN DOUBLED. Which of course is terrible! But then, that's still about <i>3% of all death causes</i>. Which encourages those who say that all this is a tempest in a teacup! <br />Oh, do I wish Randall would show up and make a nice little graph like he does so often by comparing what is important with what is not, so all of us have sure guidance about how we are to take this, if as a serious thing, or just as a blip.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Yamaplos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yamaplos (page does not exist)">Yamaplos</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaplos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Yamaplos (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:34, 19 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>For what it's worth, I have changed the transcript to refer to a "grown-up Science Girl" instead of Hairbun.  She's referred to that way in the Explanation, although I see there are several comments in this discussion arguing for Hairbun. —<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Scs (page does not exist)">Scs</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Scs (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:33, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
</p><p>It rubs me the wrong way to refer to Randall's interpretation of what the 4 horsemen are as 'incorrect.'  This is fundamentally a mythological tradition, not verifiable or falsifiable fact.  The 'war, famine, pestilence, and death' model may not be what is present in the oldest surviving written sources, but it is a part of the living tradition.  Unless you're a biblical literalist, the mythological interpretation of one person at one time is no more valid than the interpretation of others at other times.  And if you are a biblical literalist, I'm sorry, but you're just wrong.  The bible is self-contradictory.  I think I'm going to change it.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.34.32" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.34.32">172.69.34.32</a> 01:02, 26 November 2020 (UTC)
