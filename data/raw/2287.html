<p>This comic is the 13th comic in a row in a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:COVID-19" title="Category:COVID-19">series of comics</a> related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2019–20 coronavirus outbreak">2020 pandemic</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Coronavirus">coronavirus</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:SARS-CoV-2">SARS-CoV-2</a>.
</p><p>Rather than expressing humanity's fears and pessimism about the pandemic, this strip anthropomorphizes some of the pathogens which afflict humanity and presents <i>their</i> fears and pessimism about possibly going extinct.  This serves as a roundabout way of expressing hope and wonder at the ingenuity and tenacity of humans in the face of diseases past (with water sanitation, mosquito netting, and condoms) and present (with the power of social distancing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Gaynor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gloria Gaynor">Gloria Gaynor</a>'s hit song <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Survive" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:I Will Survive">I Will Survive</a></i>). Gaynor recorded <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/entertainment/coronavirus-gloria-gaynor-i-will-survive-trnd/index.html">a video of herself washing her hands</a> for 20 seconds (the recommended length of time to wash hands for optimal cleanliness) to the background of her hit song.
</p><p>The three pathogens presented are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Virus">virus</a> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a>), a small colony of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Coccus">coccus</a>-shaped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bacterium">bacterium</a> (such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Streptococcus">Streptococcus</a></i>), and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Protozoon">protozoon</a> (a caricature of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ciliate">ciliate</a>).  Bacteriophages do not infect human cells (as the name suggests, they only infect bacteria), and have been studied for use as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Phage therapy">phage therapy</a>" <i>for</i> humans, especially in dealing with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections (which is usually what people mean when they talk about "resistance" in the context of pathogens); however, they are iconic, instantly-recognizable viruses, and some have been found to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://phys.org/news/2015-11-bacteria-bacteriophages-collude-formation-clinically.html">collude with bacteria</a> in forming certain antibiotic-resistant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Biofilm">biofilms</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balantidiasis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Balantidiasis">Only one kind of ciliate</a> is known to cause human disease; however, ciliates are iconic for protozoa just as bacteriophages are for viruses (see, for example, Gary Larson's now-venerable <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.thefarside.com"><i>The Far Side</i></a> cartoons). The ciliate may be a 'stand-in' for protozoa that cause widespread and dangerous human diseases, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Malaria">malaria</a>. The drawing is wildly out of scale; a protozoon is larger than a bacterium, which in turn is much larger than a virus.
</p><p>"The scariest thing in the universe" to these microbes is the human immune system, represented in the second panel and later by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Antibody">antibodies</a> (Y-shaped drawings) and anthropomorphized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Macrophage">macrophages</a> (actual macrophages do not have glaring angry eyes<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>). When a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:T cell">T cell</a> encounters an unfamiliar molecule in the body, such as the surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2, it will search for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:B cell">B cell</a> that produces a matching antibody.  If and when it finds such a B cell, it will command the B cell to rapidly multiply and mass-produce antibodies.  Those antibodies will then bind to any antigens they contact, which may impede the antigen (as shown by the tagged protozoon in panel 2 lagging behind its siblings) and will definitely mark them for destruction by macrophages, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Phagocytosis">engulf ("HUUGGG") and digest</a> antibody-tagged objects they encounter.  T cells can also be described as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170307142718.htm">hugging cells</a>, but a hug from a T cell is used to activate other processes, while a hug from a macrophage is a precursor to digestion.  White blood cells are quite persistent once they have detected an antigen, even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xh-bkiv_c">chasing them over many cell lengths</a> in what must be a terrifying experience for the antigen being chased.
</p><p>The comic humorously considers pasta as an essential part of humans' fight against coronavirus. Pasta is an example of a dried food that can last a long time, if the orders to stay indoors continue, and was one of many products bought in mass quantities by shoppers "panic-buying" at the onset of lockdowns. Pasta is a popular dish in Italy, which is experiencing particular difficulties with COVID-19, but not every culture consumes or likes pasta. In addition, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.soundpasta.com/2020/03/gloria-gaynor-washes-her-hands-while-jamming-to-her-classic-i-will-survive/">Gaynor vid</a> was initially shared via soundpasta.com among other services, and "pasta" is sometimes used to refer to sharing over the internet via cut-and-paste. 
</p><p>The colony of cocci protests that it shouldn't be possible for humans to evolve "pathogen resistance" in the short period of months since the breakout of COVID-19, when humans require over a decade to reach sexual maturity, and in modern times often wait at least two decades before having children.  Humans develop immunity to some diseases after being infected, as some B cells become memory cells and are stored for quick re-activation in the case of a later infection, but this is not very effective against viruses which mutate rapidly, such as influenza and the common cold (which is sometimes caused by coronaviruses, although not SARS-CoV-2).  Bacteria and viruses, on the other hand, reproduce in a matter of minutes, so that there may be hundreds of generations per day (comparable to the number of generations that have passed for humanity since the beginnings of agriculture), each of which presents opportunities to evolve new antigens that are not recognized by any antibodies present in the body or to evolve resistance to whatever antibiotic drugs the host might be using.  However, as the bacteriophage explains, humans generally do not become resistant against pathogens by genetic drift (although there are researchers who are seeking to identify genes that encode resistances to various diseases and then propagate them to other humans through gene editing, as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui_affair" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:He Jiankui affair">He Jiankui affair</a>).  Instead, humans "evolve" pathogen resistance through behavioral changes.  The behaviors presented in this comic strip include:
</p>
<ul><li> Municipal water supplies, which are filtered and treated to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases, like cholera and dysentery.</li>
<li> Mosquito netting over beds, and also anti-insect poisoning, to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases, like malaria.</li>
<li> Condoms (described as plastic in the comic, but more commonly latex rubber in real life), to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases, such as AIDS and syphilis.</li>
<li> Social or physical distancing, hand-washing, storable food, and electronic communications, to prevent the spread of diseases through casual contact, like COVID-19.</li></ul>
<p>These behaviors do not come from our genomes, passed along through reproduction, but from our brains, passed along by communication.  Some of the language of epidemiology is also used in discussion of communication, most notably "going viral" -- in this case, information is going viral to prevent viruses from going viral.
</p><p>The title text reverts to the point of view of humans and references a famous line from the graphic novel <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Watchmen">Watchmen</a></i>, where the vigilante <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_(character)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rorschach (character)">Rorschach</a>, whilst in prison and surrounded by enemies who want to kill him, proclaims: "I'm not locked up in here with YOU. You're locked up in here with ME."  This presents an alternate perspective on quarantine and isolation that some may find more bearable: rather than passively hiding indoors in fear of the virus, we are taking action to fragment the virus population so that our immune systems (and medical intervention, in more serious cases) can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Defeat in detail">defeat it in detail</a>.

<dd>Bacteriophage: It's not evolution. It's something with their brains.</dd>
<dd>Protozoon: I <i>wondered</i> what those were for!</dd></dl>
<p>[Bacteriophage pointing to: Cueball and Megan looking at their phones; Megan and Cueball walking to the right; Megan and Cueball at separate sinks washing their hands.]

<p>Do bacteriophages "afflict" humanity? To my knowledge, they only infect bacteria and are even considered a possible future alternative to antibiotics by some. What is up with them being represented here? 09:12, 31 March 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Yeah, bacteriophage is just wrong here, it's a generic virus.

<dd> There are no known human viruses of that shape (source: I'm a biologist), so this seems like more of a mistake on Randall's side (albeit an odd one for him to make, so perhaps somehow deliberate?). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.91.155" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.91.155">162.158.91.155</a> 08:55, 31 March 2020 (UTC)

<p>Bacteriophages only infect bacteria and some kinds of Archaea, not humans, so the explanation is slightly wrong.

<p>This comic is a positive message giving good advice to people on how to beat the current COVID-19 spread.  But the numbers clearly show it is not working (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-52066105/coronavirus-us-death-rates-v-china-italy-and-south-Korea">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-52066105/coronavirus-us-death-rates-v-china-italy-and-south-Korea</a>, and many other locations on the internet.)  Continuing to believe this pandemic can be beat with only lock-downs, hand washing and telling people to not do things they do naturally without thinking, is the public health equivalent of engineering design with friction-less surfaces and mass-less pullies.  We need solutions that understand human nature and tell people to do things they actually will do, not keep saying the same things over and over again despite experience screaming at us that people are not doing it.  The 6 places that have controlled the outbreak (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan) have used different methods of testing, tracing, isolating, restricting travel, etc., but the one thing they have in common is a large portion of the population is wearing masks in public.  The 5 places with the largest uncontrolled outbreaks (USA (especially NYC) Italy, Spain, Germany and France) are all using the same lock down strategy and all have public health officials discouraging /  preventing people from wearing masks in public.  This should not be hard to figure out. And saying the limited supply of masks need to go to certain people, not working to increase the number of masks, is what failure looks like.  <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Godzilla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Godzilla (page does not exist)">Godzilla</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Godzilla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Godzilla (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dd>In a situation like the current one it is wise even for expert epidemiologists, virologists and medical practitioners to be very careful in their assumptions, analyses and conclusions. For anyone with little or no expertise in those fields, that goes doubly so. Note, for instance, that the regions you name as having controlled the outbreak also have very different social customs from those you name as uncontrolled. To an Italian, the everyday way Asians (excuse the generalizations) interact with each other is pretty much equivalent to "social distancing". When you regularly shake hands or hug (and then touch your nose or eyes, which people do constantly and subconsciously), the mask is not protective. In other words, there are many factors beyond simply wearing masks that can explain the current differences in virus spread, if such differences are even real (the current numbers are heavily skewed by test availability and criteria for who gets tested). More generally, we currently simply do not have enough information to confidently answer all the questions about this disease and how we should best combat it. Thus, I would recommend using expressions such as "this should not be hard to figure out" sparingly, especially given the knowledge that many very smart and highly trained people are working on "figuring it out"... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.93.105" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.93.105">162.158.93.105</a> 21:21, 31 March 2020 (UTC)

<p>These statements are true.  It is also true the the 6 places that have controlled the outbreak the best have very different social customs from each other.  Likewise with the 5 places where the outbreak is spreading the most; Germans generally do not behave in public like Italians, but both cultures are experiencing similar 2-3 day double rates.
"...given the knowledge that many very smart and highly trained people are working on "figuring it out"..."  We all know countless examples in history of "very smart and highly trained people" being wrong for very long periods of time (no-such-things-as-germs, the-earth-is-the-center-of-the-universe, etc.)  And the differences in the spread of this outbreak in different countries is not trivial; it is spreading 10s or 100s of time faster in some places then others.  These differences are not being explained adequately by the "very smart and highly trained people".  At some point we need to realize what we are being told does not match what we are seeing.  When we do we will start solving the problem. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Godzilla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Godzilla (page does not exist)">Godzilla</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Godzilla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Godzilla (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:24, 1 April 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>To summarize your argument: Because even experts *can* be wrong (true!) we should always critically evaluate any information we receive (fully agree!). If in doing so we recognize an apparently obvious and seemingly reasonable pattern, we should assume our conclusions are true (uh-oh) and the experts must be wrong (uuuh) and we should announce our truth on the internet while deriding others' efforts to handle the crisis (ouf). You may be right about the masks, you may not be right. Time and more research will surely tell. Either way, however, I hope you can appreciate why someone might take issue with your approach to the problem.

</p><p>OK the news is saying the CDC is reconsidering their position on the public wearing masks.  Note it is not you wearing a mask that protects you, but everyone else wearing one, including the people with the virus who do not show symptoms.  The mask catches many of the droplets infected people exhale, sneeze or cough out.  This reduces the amount of virus containing droplets in the air for you to breath in, reduces the virus on surfaces you touch and then bring to your face with your hand, etc.
