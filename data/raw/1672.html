<p>This comic portrays a series of press conferences with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:US Treasury">US Treasury</a> spokesperson (different from <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> in the first panel as he has a bit of hair). The panels after the first summarize and ridicule the recent controversy over the upcoming redesign of US currency. The dialog between the US Treasury and reporters is paraphrased for comedic effect, but the events depicted are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_twenty-dollar_bill#Proposal_for_a_woman.27s_portrait" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States twenty-dollar bill">otherwise factual</a> (including the punchline).
</p><p>American currency has only once had a woman as the primary portrait on paper currency (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/martha-washington/martha-on-1/">Martha Washington</a> was on the $1 Silver Certificate in the 1880's and 1890's), which is widely seen as a real problem. A large-scale petition was organized which advocated replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_twenty-dollar_bill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States twenty-dollar bill">$20 bill</a> with a woman, to be chosen by public voting. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson#Indian_removal_policy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andrew Jackson">forced re-locations</a> of Native American peoples that Andrew Jackson conducted during his presidency. This is now seen as a human rights violation on a massive scale, and is presented as a reason why Andrew Jackson should not be honored on American currency.
</p><p>The timing of the release of this new bill with a woman was to be scheduled with the 100 year anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Women&#39;s suffrage in the United States">Women's suffrage</a> in 2020 and should thus preferably also be on the $20 bill.
</p><p>The voting process <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.womenon20s.org/results">selected</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Harriet Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a>, a 19th century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionist" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Abolitionist">abolitionist</a> and a major figure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> system which freed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Slavery in the United States">American slaves</a>. Cueball is seen to be clearly pleased and excited about this prospect in the first panel, where he votes for her first, among several other options.
</p><p>The list shows that Cueball chooses Tubman first representing the generic everyman and thus represents the about one in five that choose her first. But he may select up to three out of the fifteen selected candidates.
</p>
<ul><li>The other two women he chooses are:
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> an American politician, diplomat, and activist. She was the longest-serving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:First Lady of the United States">First Lady of the United States</a>, holding the post from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s four terms in office. She became the runner-up in the vote.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Carson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>, a pioneering environmentalist who is most famous for her book <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i>.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Since Carson was not one of the options for the final round, where only four were selected (the other two were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a>, 3rd; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilma_Mankiller" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wilma Mankiller">Wilma Mankiller</a>, 4th), it is clear that Cueball was already voting in the primary ballot, where Roosevelt actually came in first.
</p><p>At this point, bureaucratic and political complications arise. The Treasury Department announces that, instead of replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, she would replace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_ten-dollar_bill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States ten-dollar bill">$10 bill</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_ten-dollar_bill#Future_redesign" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States ten-dollar bill">reason given</a> is that the $10 bill was scheduled for redesign first. A reporter asks why they can't simply change the schedule, but doesn't get a clear answer.
</p><p>There is a suggestion from "Steve" to put <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Martin Shkreli">Martin Shkreli</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_five-dollar_bill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States five-dollar bill">$5 bill</a>. Shkreli is a pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager who provoked controversy when he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Price_hike_controversy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Martin Shkreli">acquired the rights to an anti-parasite drug and raised the price</a> by over 5000%, making it unaffordable for many people. He became known as "the most hated man in America". Naturally, Steve's suggestion receives short shrift, not least of which because it's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.quora.com/Can-anybody-or-anything-be-put-on-American-currency-other-than-dead-presidents">a violation of Treasury policy and US law</a> (as Shkreli is still alive). This may be the same Steve who messed up both <a href="/wiki/index.php/809:_Los_Alamos" title="809: Los Alamos">809: Los Alamos</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1532:_New_Horizons" title="1532: New Horizons">1532: New Horizons</a>.
</p><p>The plan to replace Hamilton likely seemed like an uncontroversial decision at the time. He was not especially well known among the American public and few people had an emotional attachment to his legacy. However, this changed abruptly when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hamilton (musical)">a Broadway musical</a> about his life came out and become massively popular. By total coincidence, this play creates a flood of interest in Hamilton right at the time the currency decisions are being made and makes replacing his portrait politically complicated. The spokesperson suggests putting both Hamilton and Tubman on the $10 bill, but the reporters are clearly unhappy with this solution, probably because it seems to dilute the recognition being given to Tubman.
</p><p>Finally, the spokesperson announces that they will put Tubman on the $20 bill, but their schedule demands that they do the $10 bill first. They decide to put a "mural to women" on the new $10 bill to try and contain the tension until the new $20 bill is released. The reporters say that the Treasury has total control over the release of currency, so the simpler solution is just to change the schedule, but they apparently ignore that suggestion.
</p><p>In the final panel, the spokesperson mentions that Jackson's portrait will still appear on the new $20 bill, seriously weakening the symbolism of replacing him and adding irony since Jackson was a slave owner. This is likely an effort to head off the complaints of traditionalists, but is seen here as an unfortunate attempt to avoid taking a real stand.
</p><p>In the title text <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> reiterates that this is a rare case in politics in which there's a clear and simple solution. The Treasury has the authority to redesign currency, and a petition to Congress could change the release schedule to fit their needs. That makes all the compromises and backtracking unnecessary: they could simply replace Jackson with Tubman and hypothetically release the new $20 bill whenever they choose. Randall appears frustrated with the artificial constraints that are holding back what should be a simple and straightforward process although he does acknowledge that it takes time to evaluate the security of a redesign's resistance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_money" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Counterfeit money">counterfeiting</a>.
</p><p>The mention of the "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://google.com/search?q=illuminati+confirmed">weird pyramid eye thing</a>" is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Eye of Providence">Eye of Providence</a>, which is an old and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Illuminati">somewhat arcane symbol</a> that appears on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States one-dollar bill">US $1 bill</a>. Randall seems to be using this as an example of the outdated and frankly strange design of American currency, the implication that using that on all US dollar bills would constitute giving up on ever having a design relevant to the modern world. Also by replacing all portraits with this image, there would no longer be any gender controversy.
</p><p>As of 2020, progress on updating both the $10 and the $20 has stalled, with the Treasury stating that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/harriet-tubman-bill.html">no new changes will be unveiled until 2026</a>.

<p>One (potentially) legitimate concern I have seen expressed regarding the proposed rollout date for the redesigned $20s is that we may not be using paper money anymore by then!

</p><p>The weird creepy looking eye thing is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence">Eye of Providence</a>.  And now that Randall mentioned it, I somehow have an intense emotional need to see a series of US currency with the Eye of Providence as the featured portrait on every bill....

<dl><dd>I think the humor of the Eye of Providence reference (which is on the US$1 banknote BTW) is that it's often referred to as a sign of the Illuminati. The Illuminati is often used in conspiracy theories, so replacing all of the faces with that sign specifically would not so much enrage people as much as people would be calling Illuminati takeovers. Ergo to not trigger the conspiracy theorist paranoia in our country (i'm US American, BTW) that would likely never happen. Also our $1 bill, which is the only bill to have the Eye of Providence(&amp; no building on the back side) hasn't been changed since like the 1960s, because of vending machine lobbyists. So the anachronisms of that IMO is really annoying.</dd></dl>

The real question: why can't the Treasury leave the $10 bill alone, redesign the $20 bill (with Harriet Tubman on both sides), and release that redesign in the 2020s as planned? There is no rush here, so long as it is done.

</p><p>There's been a furor over here in the UK about (losing) a woman from our paper money. (Not the Queen, at least not just yet, although having just turned 90...)

<dl><dd>Luckily, someone explained it on wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_banknotes" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Euro banknotes">Euro banknotes</a>: the 5 euro note has a generic rendition of Classical architecture, the 10 euro note of Romanesque architecture, the 20 euro note of Gothic architecture, the 50 euro note of the Renaissance, the 100 euro note of Baroque and Rococo, the 200 euro note of Art Nouveau and the 500 euro note of modern architecture. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 23:51, 25 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>The explanation claims "The current rule about changing the $10 next before they can change the $20 comes from Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and the Treasurer is powerless to work against it." However, I've just read through the text of that Section of that Act several times, and I can't find any wording to justify this claim. If this is a valid claim, could someone point more explicitly to where the Act restricts the order in which bills can be redesigned? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Rhwentworth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rhwentworth (page does not exist)">Rhwentworth</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Rhwentworth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Rhwentworth (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:27, 26 April 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>This just in - Treasury decides to print a new $9 bill with Andrew Jackson on it. -<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.16" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.16">162.158.255.16</a> 04:43, 26 April 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>This whole controversy is one reason why there are no real objects on the Euro notes. The individual nation's currencies did have real persons (including women - at least in Germany) or real "things" in a wider sense on them and changing them was often as complicated as depicted here. The current pictures on the Euro notes represent specific architectural styles (e.g. Gothic or Baroque), but the buildings and facades shown don't exist. I don't know if this should be part of the explanation as a side note or something, but I felt it would be nice to know, that other states or organisiations had similar struggles and actually found a compromise. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User:Elektrizikekswerk">Elektrizikekswerk</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User talk:Elektrizikekswerk">talk</a>) 07:48, 26 April 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I think that three examples (where it is just a name, for someone not shown) is too little for a new category. If you can find other places where it is similarly used then maybe. But be careful when searching since a "Steve" search will find real people like Steve Jobs and Seven Spielberg for instance...

<dl><dd>Hamilton is a real Broadway musical featuring a race-bent Andrew Hamilton, completely done in the style of modern hip-hop. It's considered to be groundbreaking if suffering from some severe historical inaccuracies (the most obvious being the titular character's race). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Riomhaire&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Riomhaire (page does not exist)">Riomhaire</a></dd></dl>
<p>One thing I feel the need to add here is that the Trail of Tears was a human rights violation due to the chiefs, not due to Andrew Jackson. While it still wasn't exactly the morally right thing to do, relocating the tribes along the Trail, the chiefs did not include their slaves in the "census" they gave to the army, resulting in a huge supply shortage. Had the chiefs considered their tribes' slaves people and counted them in the number that was given to Jackson and the army, the Trail of Tears would have been a Trail of Discomfort and Frustration instead. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Riomhaire&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Riomhaire (page does not exist)">Riomhaire</a>
</p>
<dl><dd>The humans rights violation was the forced relocation of people off their own land by people who want to take it? With no compensation (At the time) and plenty of violence throughout? Also, while that is the bad thing he was known for, Jackson was insane in many other ways, too. I’m not even going to go into the last part. It still would’ve been a trail of tears if they were given heaps of gold and fed well. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Netherin5" title="User:Netherin5">Netherin5</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Netherin5" title="User talk:Netherin5">talk</a>) 13:46, 21 March 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Surely part of the humour here is the reporters being totally unconcerned about something as important as the security of currency and instead making a massive fuss over something largely irrelevant (i.e. what picture is printed on the notes)? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.226" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.226">172.70.110.226</a> 18:48, 19 July 2021 (UTC)
