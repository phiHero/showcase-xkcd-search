<p>This is an <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Interactive_comics" title="Category:Interactive comics">interactive comic</a> made to celebrate the release of <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall's</a> new book, <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/Thing_Explainer" title="Thing Explainer">Thing Explainer</a></i>, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday, November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The <a href="/wiki/index.php/Header_text" title="Header text">header text</a> also <a href="/wiki/index.php/Header_text#2015-11-24_-_Thing_Explainer_is_out_today" title="Header text">changed that day</a> to shout out that the book was released on that day. This is a platforming minigame, in which you collect coins while riding on a hoverboard.
</p><p>The title refers to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverboard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hoverboard">hoverboard</a> (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ZdMOMUgXE">prominently featured</a> in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Back to the Future Part II">Back to the Future Part II</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_McFly" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Marty McFly">Marty McFly</a> traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.facebook.com/October212015BTTF">2015-10-21</a>, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33785285">have</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HI137m7XA4">come</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLwNGBB_Yb0">to</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/hendo-2-hoverboard/">pass</a> before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.terrafugia.com/">flying</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-1pXbW5wVg">cars</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.soundandvision.com/content/wear-your-music-thinkgeeks-soundtrack-shirt#jo8J1DassbWxlptj.97">musical clothing</a>. Randall is known to have had <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Electric_skateboard" title="Category:Electric skateboard">electric skateboards</a>, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1623:_2016_Conversation_Guide" title="1623: 2016 Conversation Guide">1623: 2016 Conversation Guide</a>.
</p><p>Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a> movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as <a href="#Reference_to_Thing_Explainer">references to <i>Thing Explainer</i></a>. Instead, the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.

</td></tr></table>
<p>The game features an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Animated">animated</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> riding on a hoverboard which can take <a href="#Animation">several different positions</a>. The controls are the left, up, and right arrows, as written on the start screen until you begin the game, after which the text disappears. There are alternatives as explained in the <a href="#Controls">Controls</a> section. The player can jump repeatedly mid-jump to reach increasing heights, and can move left and right both while jumping and descending (see more under controls).
</p><p>The player begins in a line-drawing maze (called the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a9/All_play_area_hanging_all_coins.PNG">Play Area</a>) with 17 gold coins located throughout and a "deposit" terminal. The ostensible goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible and return them to the deposit in the fastest possible time, which returns <a href="#Messages_in_Play_Area">text messages</a> describing the result. Players consumed with obtaining the best possible time result for collecting the coins may not realize there is anything more to the game.
</p><p>Beyond the maze on either side (just far enough that players who remain within the maze will not see) are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/8b/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Coins_Hoverboard_and_View.png">tall walls seemingly designed to contain the player</a>. However, the walls have a finite height and, combined with the ability to double-jump, the player can leave the purported "play area" either to the sides or above the initial maze. This returns a flashing red <a href="#Messages_in_Play_Area">error message</a>: "<b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/Return_to_the_play_area.PNG">Return to the Play Area</a></b>".
</p><p>But if the player overcomes the desire to comply and return to the play area and disregards this message, they can take hoverboard Cueball outside beyond the tall walls surrounding the initial play area. And here they will discover an entire world that can be explored left and right (and above), including numerous points of interest and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Easter egg (media)">Easter eggs</a> similar in style to comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1110:_Click_and_Drag" title="1110: Click and Drag">1110: Click and Drag</a>. There are also many more <a href="#Coins">coins</a> to collect, 169 coins overall, so 152 more than those from the play area. There are also 116 in the right side alone, and 36 on the left.
</p><p>Although this game is reminiscent of Click and Drag, this was the first time an actual game, where the user moves an object in front of the drawing, has been released on xkcd. In previous "games" this has not been the case. In Click and Drag the user only moves the drawing into the view section. And in for instance the two previous <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:April_fools%27_comics" title="Category:April fools&#39; comics">April fools' comics</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1350:_Lorenz" title="1350: Lorenz">1350: Lorenz</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1506:_xkcloud" title="1506: xkcloud">1506: xkcloud</a>, the user does not move anything, but only supplies choices, text and drawings. However, already on the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:April Fools&#39; Day">April Fools' Day</a> a new game, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1663:_Garden" title="1663: Garden">1663: Garden</a>, was released where the users also actively moved items around on the screen and could make items disappear (like taking coins in this game.). The ability to infinitely doubles jump allows us to reach beyond just the ground.

<p>There are many themes and references throughout the game, but the two main themes are <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars">Star Wars</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></b>. Below there is a <a href="#List_of_details_and_references">table</a> listing all references to both of these movies and much more. For instance, there are 19 references to SW and 6 to LOTR.
</p><p>The largest part of the game is located on the <b>right side</b> of the play area and is mainly a world dominated by references to <i>Star Wars</i>. Most noticeable is a recreation of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/yHfLyMAHrQE?t=112">the opening scene</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars (film)">first film</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Princess Leia">Princess Leia's</a> space ship <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantive_IV" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tantive IV">Tantive IV</a></i>, also known as <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/82/1608_1015x1078y_Entire_Rebel_Blockade_Runner_zoom_out.png">The Rebel Blockade Runner</a></i>, is flying over <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/33/1608_1015x1073y_Ponytail_in_the_dunes_zoom_out.png">the desert</a> planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatooine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tatooine">Tatooine</a>. Here it is followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Destroyer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a>, <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Devastator">Devastator</a></i>. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/04/1608_1015x1078y_Entire_Rebbel_Blockade_Runner_zoom_out_to_torpedoes_and_ground.png">desert ground with these two space ships</a> above is the first you find to the right. Although in the game they are located inside the atmosphere, not as in the movie out in space, a fact that is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1d/1608_1049x1090y_Atmosphere_worry_and_car_room_at_bottom_of_hull.png">commented on</a> by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> who looks out from an opening in the bottom of the Destroyer's hull. 
</p>
<dl><dd>Megan: Is this ship designed to fly in the atmosphere like this? </dd></dl>
<p>Both ships are high above the ground, but there are three <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/76/1608_1014x1076y_Entire_wires_from_ground_to_Runner.png">wires from the ground</a> that connect (and thus guide you) up to <i>The Runner</i> and from there <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/87/1608_1023x1085y_Entire_torpedoes_rain_from_Runner_to_Destroyer.png">100+ torpedoes</a>, which are fired <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f1/1608_1018x1079y_Top_rear_end_of_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">down on the Runner</a> coming <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/1608_1034x1091y_Torpedo_canon_below_Destroyer.png">from the Destroyer</a> above, gives away the location of the Destroyer itself. The Destroyer is so high up in the air, that you would not be likely to find it by chance without these leads (or at least some of the several other hints from people on the ground <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f2/1608_1010x1073y_Cliff_with_rock_and_cactus.png">looking up and reacting</a> or like <a href="/wiki/index.php/White_Hat" title="White Hat">White Hat</a> looking from the tip of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/21/1608_0995x1079y_Entire_Washington_monument_extra_zoom_out.png">Washington Monument</a> and reacting <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6f/1608_0995x1083y_Tip_of_Washington_monument.png">by saying</a>: "Uh, what the heck is <i>that?!</i>."). There is also a giant island floating very high above the lamppost in the left side of the world, with no indication of its existence.
</p><p>One of the main points (The Joke) of the entire game is the extreme size of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cd/1608_Entire_Star_Destroyer.png">such a Destroyer</a>. It takes up more space than the rest of the game (and most of the coins are located there). Inside the Destroyer there are many, many rooms, long corridors and deep shafts, even a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/58/1608_Entire_Cave.png">huge cave</a> with trees and animals. At <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c7/1608_Vader_twice_and_emperor_on_and_near_bridge.png">the bridge</a> we meet both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> and the Emperor himself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Palpatine">Palpatine</a>. There are many other jokes related both to Star Wars and other movies and xkcd comics inside the Destroyer. For instance, Darth Vader discusses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Steven Universe">Steven Universe</a>, bringing up Rose Quartz and Steven himself (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/39/1608_1031x1095y_Steven_Universe_family_and_ice_cream_prediction.png">who can be found with the Crystal Gems</a> in a different part of the Destroyer).
</p>
<dl><dd>Darth Vader: But Steven's <i>mother</i> is a Crystal Gem...</dd></dl>
<p>There are also interesting things and references along the ground beneath the Destroyer, some of these are also Star Wars related like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c9/1608_1038x1073y_Wedding_and_picnic.png">the wedding scene</a> where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a> is mentioned. 
</p><p>To the <b>left side</b> is an entirely different world, although much smaller (shorter) than the one to the right. Here the main theme is <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> mainly with the presence of a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6a/Entire_Volcano_zoom_out.png">volcano</a> where for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/77/1608_0952x1087y_Ring_of_power_and_lave_floor_at_the_right_crater_top.png">Megan tries to throw</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:One Ring"><i>rings</i> of power</a>, as in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpF3SUFaDw">the scene</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King">last LOTR film</a> where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Frodo Baggins">Frodo</a> fails and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gollum">Gollum</a> attacks inside the volcano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Doom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mount Doom">Mount Doom</a>, thus making it clear that the volcano in the xkcd game represents Mt. Doom. Frodo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sauron">Sauron</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gandalf">Gandalf</a> are all mentioned in the game. The first two by name in the text. Two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Eagle (Middle-earth)">great eagles</a> are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cb/1608_0956x1088y_Eagles_over_right_crater_top.png">talking about Frodo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:J. R. R. Tolkien">Tolkien</a>, Sauron's name is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/66/1608_0964x1078y_Megan_reading_for_children_about_Saurons_ring.png">read up by Megan from a book</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a5/1608_0944x1083y_Rock_with_Gandalf_in_Lava_lake.png">Gandalf is drawn as a wizard figure</a> in the crater and also his name is used in the <a href="#Messages_in_Play_Area">message</a> you receive if you collect <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f7/169_coins_fastest_way.PNG">all possible coins</a>.  
</p><p>The two worlds do conflict though, as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-wing_fighter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:X-wing fighter">X-wing fighter</a> is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/44/1608_0982x1077y_Gas_station_with_x-wing.png">parked at a gas station</a> to the left in LOTR world, and Gandalf's famous quote <i>You shall not pass!</i> from his fight against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Balrog">Balrog</a> is modified by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> who is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ad/1608_1026x1093y_Shall_not_not_pass_room_and_parachutes_at_one_of_two_ledges_at_bottom_of_hull.png"><i>not</i> trying to block your path</a> to a coin inside a room in the Destroyer. This conflict could very well be a reference to the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andy Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> who played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gollum">Gollum</a> in LOTR, now plays the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supreme Leader Snoke">Supreme Leader Snoke</a> in the new Star Wars movie, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/6/64/Supremeleader.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20151223201852">his appearance</a> as Snoke is not that much different from Gollum's. Snoke also delivers a line in the movie (about "bringing someone to me") that reminds one of Gollum when he talks about "the ring coming to me". Randall would not have known this last part at the time that this comic was released, but he would likely be aware of Andy Serkis' involvement.
</p><p>Other themes are related to other movies, like a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/star-trek-fans-rivalry-george-lucas-roddenberry/">naughty reference</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Trek">Star Trek</a> from inside <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">the bridge</a> of the Rebel Blockade Runner where a long-haired woman (maybe <a href="/wiki/index.php/Danish" title="Danish">Danish</a> since she obviously does this to annoy Star Wars fans and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairbun" title="Hairbun">Hairbun</a> behind her, which could represent Princess Leia with her <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Princess_Leia%27s_characteristic_hairstyle.jpg">special hair style</a>) delivers the following line taken from the Star Trek universe: 
</p>
<dl><dd>Long haired woman: Captain's log, stardate November 24th, 2015...</dd>
<dd>Hairbun: <i>Augh!</i> No!</dd></dl>
<p>Also references to video games are seen, best shown with the maze towards the back end of the Destroyer which are an almost <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e2/1608_Comparing_Prince_of_Persia_maze_with_real_level_1.png">complete depiction</a> of <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/a/a2/Princeofpersia_dos_level1.png">Level 1</a></i> of the computer game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prince of Persia">Prince of Persia</a></i> down to the three coins being in the place of three items to take in that game, and at least two of the opposing sword fighters in the correct places as well. 
</p><p>The comic/game and book were released only 3 weeks before the 7th Star Wars movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars: The Force Awakens">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></i> was released on December 14, 2015. And this movie had already been referenced by Randall 7½ weeks earlier in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1585:_Similarities" title="1585: Similarities">1585: Similarities</a>, when another movie (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Martian (film)">The Martian</a>) were released. It was a reference in the title text to the new robot <i>BB-8</i> that are featured in the Force Awakens. That the Star Wars section is thus so much larger than the LOTR section could be a hint to the fact that it is now 12 years ago that the last of those films were released, and although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Hobbit">the Hobbit</a> has been released as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Hobbit (film series)">three films</a> over the previous three Christmases it was Star Wars that dominated the Christmas a month after this comic's release.

<p>Some of the scenes in this game are references to pictures in the new book that it celebrates. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul><li>The original comic that was the impetus for <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/Thing_Explainer" title="Thing Explainer">Thing Explainer</a></i> in the first place, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1133:_Up_Goer_Five" title="1133: Up Goer Five">1133: Up Goer Five</a>, is also included in the book. These are both referenced in this game by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e2/1608_0976x1079y_Space_capsule_with_parachutes.png">space capsule</a> used for reentry by the astronauts that flew to the moon using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Saturn V">Saturn Five</a> rocket. This capsule is floating down over the plateau before the volcano to the left. </li>
<li>In <i>Sky Toucher</i>, the last entry explaining a skyscraper, there are several references to the game, one of these being the space capsule just mentioned above. Other references:
<ul><li>Ponytail throwing a paper plane out, which she also does <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/20/1608_1077x1107y_Tarkin_on_the_bridge_and_Ponytail_with_paper_plane.png">below the bridge</a> of the Destroyer. (This is also a reference to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://explainxkcd.com/1110">Click and Drag</a> where <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/clickdrag/6n2w.png">Cueball does the same</a>, here even from a skyscraper).</li>
<li>Cueball is setting up a kite and Ponytail is crawling up in the line. In the comic a small girl looking like Megan <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/1608_0970x1077y_Kite_and_weird_bug.png">also has a kite</a>. Being up in a kite is also referenced in both <a href="/wiki/index.php/235:_Kite" title="235: Kite">235: Kite</a> and in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1614:_Kites" title="1614: Kites">1614: Kites</a> (from just a few weeks after the release of this comic.)</li>
<li>There is a floor in the middle of the building with trees, just like there is a cave inside the Destroyer <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/75/1608_1053x1093y_Lake_with_tree_birds_and_puma_on_rock_at_exit_in_the_bottom_left_side_of_the_cave.png">with a tree "inside"</a>.</li>
<li>Cueball is holding a fishing rod out over the side of the building letting the hook hand in the air. The same <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/58/1608_1014x1078y_Three_wires_and_reaching_up_to_anchors_in_Runner.png">can be seen</a> under the Rebel Blockage Runner.</li>
<li>Megan is using a skateboard in a strange ellipsoid-shaped room. This can be a reference both to where Megan is seen on a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/89/1608_1038x1095y_Hamsterball_and_stilts_room.png">skateboard inside a hamster ball</a> and to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7b/1608_1078x1111y_Globe_of_Death_at_the_top_of_the_Destroyer.png">globe of death</a> at the top of the bridge on the Destroyer.</li>
<li>There is a car in the top section of the tower (long away from the parking cellar in the basement). There are two <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1d/1608_1049x1090y_Atmosphere_worry_and_car_room_at_bottom_of_hull.png">cars inside</a> the Destroyer, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d4/1608_1048x1099y_Cueball_on_hood_of_car_room_and_a_giant_step_with_coins_at_top_of_hull.png">one of them</a> deep inside with no easy access to the outside.</li>
<li>Two people are standing on a cloud, one of them (Megan) jumps out from it. This is similar to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/9/92/1608_0993x1112y_Top_of_floating_rock_island_with_base_jumpers.png">two base jumpers</a> on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5c/1608_0994x1110y_Entire_floating_rock_island_zoom_out.png">rock island</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the <i>Red world space car</i> explaining (about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_Rover" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Curiosity Rover">Curiosity Rover</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mars">Mars</a>) there are two references to the scenes around the Rebel Blockade Runner:
<ul><li>Curiosity toasts a marshmallow over a fire as does Megan and Cueball over the exhaust pipe at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f1/1608_1018x1079y_Top_rear_end_of_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">the rear of the Runner</a>.</li>
<li>When Curiosity is set down on Mars by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mars Science Laboratory">Mars Science Laboratory</a> (MSL), lowered down in wires below the MSL, the wires were released once the rover was down and then it flies away. In the book Megan is hanging from one of these wires when it flies away. This is similar to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/76/1608_1014x1076y_Entire_wires_from_ground_to_Runner.png">Megan hanging in one of the anchor lines</a> going from the ground up to the Runner.</li></ul></li>
<li>In <i>The USS Laws of the Land</i> about the ship called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:USS Constitution">USS Constitution</a> (named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a> which is explained in the entry just before this one), there are two references to this comic:
<ul><li>There is both a giant octopus' arm (marked as <i>not real</i>) and a very large octopus under the ship. The shape of the octopus is the same as the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b5/1608_1038x1094y_Giant_octopus_in_Destroyer.png">silhouette of a giant octopus</a> inside the Destroyer. 
<ul><li>Octopuses like this are often used in xkcd, and they are also included in the explanation about <i>Writing sticks</i> (as the source of ink for the pens), as a motive in <i>Picture taker</i> and in <i>Tree of life</i>. As an example, from another xkcd comic with octopuses see for instance <a href="/wiki/index.php/435:_Purity" title="435: Purity">435: Purity</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>There is also a bowling alley in the hull of the ship - a reference to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/53/1608_0987x1075y_Hamsterball_bowling.png">hamster ball bowling</a> in the left part of the world.
<ul><li>Bowling is also used two other places in the book, namely on the suspension of the longest bridge in <i>Tall roads</i> and a bowling alley is used for measuring length in <i>How to count things</i>. </li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Ants are used three times in the book. A zoom-in on an ant is used to indicate size in <i>Earth's past</i> about geological ages of the Earth, and under the <i>Tree</i> in that explanation there is an ant colony where one ant is much bigger than the others; an ant queen, a clear reference to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d2/1608_1078x1095y_Ant_Queen_in_Destroyer.png">ant queen</a> in the Destroyer. They are of course also in the <i>Tree of life</i>.</li>
<li>Basketball is shown twice in this comic (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a4/1608_0936x1084y_Basketball_on_the_volcano.png">left of volcano</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1d/1608_1067x1104y_Basket_ball_on_top_of_Destroyer.png">on top of Destroyer</a>). In the book the size of different <i>Playing Fields</i> is one of the stories, and it included the field for basketball (i.e. <i>circle ball</i>).</li>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d0/1608_1046x1074y_Huge_foot.png">huge foot</a> before the pyramid look like the foot used in the explanation for <i>How to count things</i> to describe the wight "one kilo" using a picture labeled <i>one foot</i> (i.e. not the length one foot, as the length is given in meters).

<p>There are also many references to other xkcd comics, like the room at the front end of the Destroyer <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a7/1608_1004x1095y_Very_front_with_playpen_balls_pit_at_top_of_hull.png">ball pit</a> filled with <b><a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Playpen_balls" title="Category:Playpen balls">playpen balls</a></b>, and two adults playing in it, like in <a href="/wiki/index.php/150:_Grownups" title="150: Grownups">150: Grownups</a>.

</p><p>There have been many comics with electric skateboards as mentioned, which do not appear in this comic, but there is one example of a normal <b>skateboard</b>.

</p><p>In the weeks before, and especially the weeks after there were also other comics that had a subject which could refer back to Hoverboard in some ways. Maybe these comics were either influenced by the game, or the other way around so that relevant items were added to the game because of these other comics:

<p>Almost all main <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Characters" title="Category:Characters">characters</a> in the xkcd gallery are used more than once, especially there are three characters that are used several times. Number one is of course <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> (with close to 90 appearances) who is already shown at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6c/1608_1000x1074y_The_Play_Area.png">starting point</a>. He is also the first character seen when walking both <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c0/1608_1004x1074y_Cueball_outside_play_area.png">right</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/dc/1608_0994x1074y_Base_of_Washington_monument.png">left</a> (where he speaks the first line to the left).
</p><p>Then follows <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> with at least 40 appearances, she is even shown twice in the same location three times, one of these three even occurs within one of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1090:-1088+s.png">small images</a>. She is also shown with Cueball in his first appearance to the left, and she is the first to speak a line to the right <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f2/1608_1010x1073y_Cliff_with_rock_and_cactus.png">here</a>. 
</p><p>Also <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> is well represented with 26 appearances (for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/2d/1608_0947x1073y_Antenna_cave_in_lair.png">here)</a>. 
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairy" title="Hairy">Hairy</a> (with different hair styles) is used 7 times (for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/54/1608_Actual_Bridge_with_Vader_and_Tarkin.png">here</a>) and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairbun" title="Hairbun">Hairbun</a> is used 5 times (for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e4/1608_1054x1099y_Corridor_peristalsis_and_two_coin_rooms_at_top_of_hull.png">here)</a>. 
</p><p>Two of the main characters are used twice: <a href="/wiki/index.php/Beret_Guy" title="Beret Guy">Beret Guy</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4f/1608_0990x1074y_If_loving_you_is_wrong_I_dont_want_to.png">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/21/1608_1020x1083y_Torpedoes_two_steps_above_Runner_with_Beret_Guy.png">here</a>) and <a href="/wiki/index.php/White_Hat" title="White Hat">White Hat</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6f/1608_0995x1083y_Tip_of_Washington_monument.png">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d9/1608_1093x1074y_White_Hat_hiding_in_the_grass.png">here</a>).
</p><p>The only exception is that the main villain of xkcd <a href="/wiki/index.php/Black_Hat" title="Black Hat">Black Hat</a> who is very hard to find. He is only <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/68/1608_1069x1093y_Deer_and_exit_below_lamp_coin_and_Black_Hat_in_the_bottom_right_side_of_the_cave.png">shown once</a> in the comic where he very uncharacteristically just sits and snores at the right wall in the cave inside the Destroyer (is it really him...?). The only other hint that he is not forgotten is that his hat can be seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1073x1074y_Ponytail_and_bird_black_hat_on_a_stick_and_Cueball_whistling.png">on a stick</a> under the Destroyer after the three large T-like structures.  And this is not that kind of stick characters Randall usually draws. But at least we now know where Danish has hidden it from him this time (see <a href="/wiki/index.php/405:_Journal_3" title="405: Journal 3">405: Journal 3</a>). Given that his hat is stuck there, he could also be any of the Cueballs close by…
</p><p>Also <a href="/wiki/index.php/Blondie" title="Blondie">Blondie</a> seems to be only represented once, while in her reporter mode while discovering a bug before the volcano as can be seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/1608_0970x1077y_Kite_and_weird_bug.png">here</a>. 
</p><p>There are also several characters that are not recognizable as either any of the standard xkcd characters or in any other way (see for instance a few of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a6/1037x1073y_Wedding.png">wedding guests</a>). But there are possibly some of the minor characters are used like <a href="/wiki/index.php/Danish" title="Danish">Danish</a> at the bridge in the Blockade Runner (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">here</a>) but this cannot be confirmed, she just looks like her and has some similarities teasing the Star Wars fan.
</p><p>Several places in the comic it is clear from the size and the behavior that some of the characters are kids, see for instance the Blondie image mentioned above, where two kids looking like Megan and Hairy stand behind her, but they would in principle not be Megan or Hairy despite appearance, as these named characters are adults.
</p><p>There are also many fictive people from different movies, books, and shows; for instance Darth Vader (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fa/1608_1077x1109y_Darth_Vaders_talks_about_Steven_Universe_on_the_bridge_Megan_adjust_antenna.png">here</a>), Gandalf (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a5/1608_0944x1083y_Rock_with_Gandalf_in_Lava_lake.png">here</a>) and Steven Universe (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/39/1608_1031x1095y_Steven_Universe_family_and_ice_cream_prediction.png">here</a>) all three mentioned above, and some real life people: you can find <a href="/wiki/index.php/Elon_Musk" title="Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a>, who has a <a href="#Secret_passages_and_hidden_places">hidden lair</a> under the Volcano (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/73/1608_0945x1074y_Elon_Musks_cave_in_lair.png">here</a>), and Gregor Mendel, hanging out on a Star Destroyer with a pea plant.
</p><p>Furthermore, there are many animals (like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b0/1608_1067x1094y_Gazebo_puma_deer_Cueball_with_bow_and_talk_of_Palpatine_in_the_middle_of_the_cave.png">the puma and the deer</a>) in the cave, some even rather big like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b5/1608_1038x1094y_Giant_octopus_in_Destroyer.png">octopus</a> or even gigantic like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d2/1608_1078x1095y_Ant_Queen_in_Destroyer.png">ant queen</a> (all three from inside the Destroyer). There are also a couple of small Star Wars robots, one in a corridor in each spaceship (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/df/1608_1034x1091y_Photon_canon_Tetris_piece_and_mini_robot_at_bottom_of_hull.png">here from the Destroyer</a>).

<ul><li>There have before been several interactive comics and also a few with animations. But these animations have typically been something along the lines of flashing text or changing lights.
<ul><li>This comic is the first with a character that is specifically changing position in animation style.</li>
<li>Apart from this there are also flashing text when leaving the play-area and text that appears and disappears when handing in coins at the terminal as described above under <a href="#Messages_in_Play_Area">Messages in Play Area</a>.</li>
<li>This also happens with the text written to begin with explaining how to play the game: <i>Use the arrow keys to move</i> which disappears when touching the keys.</li></ul></li>
<li>Here are two images showing two kinds of animation of the hoverboard Cueball. 
<ul><li>The first image shows the eight standard animation that can easily be seen. They are
<ul><li>Standing still facing right (starting position)</li>
<li>Standing still facing left</li>
<li>Moving left along flat ground (lifting arms)</li>
<li>Moving right along flat ground (lifting arms)</li>

<ul><li>But there are several in between drawings of the hoverboard Cueball turning from left to right and even more from right to left. 
<ul><li>The second image shows eight in between animations (together with four from above)-</li>
<li>Not all possible positions are necessarily caught in this collage here, but there is only a limited amount of them and none of them last for more than a split second.</li>
<li>They have been sorted so it could look like Cueball has just turned to the right standing still, then jumping while turning right, then turning right while in jump, to finish the turn while falling. </li>
<li>Image 2, 3, 5 and the last are the same used in the image of standard animations</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>There are many places where you can disappear behind black areas, as not all of these are solid. You might have discovered this yourself if you stayed in the play area, as the platform below the inverted parentheses is only solid at the edges. Some of these places out of the play area even hide secret passages or hidden rooms. You can reveal them by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard#Cheats_and_Exploits">activating goggles mode</a>.
</p><p>One notable hidden area is Elon Musk's volcano lair, which is located beneath the lava in the crater of Mount Doom. It can be difficult to find your way in here without using goggles mode even if you know it is there. (For more details, see <a href="/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard/Images_of_secret_passages" title="1608: Hoverboard/Images of secret passages">secret passages</a>.)
</p><p>Another hidden place is the floating rock island that floats high above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a>, which is almost the highest point with solid ground. It is located just outside the left edge of the play area. This island is almost impossible to find by chance, as it takes around 30 seconds of repeatedly pressing the Up Arrow key to reach it from the top of the Monument. Even if you go up enough, you will almost miss it, as the Monument is not aligned to the island. (The <a href="#Viewers">maps</a> can help you if you're having trouble finding it.)
</p><p>As there are two coins on the floating rock island and four coins in the lair below the lava, it is very hard to find all the coins. There are even several coins that are hard to find because they just float in the air nowhere near any drawn things, or at least no things you can see before seeing the coin. They may hang in the air a few jumps above the ground, or in one case more than a seconds drop below the Destroyer. Getting all coins without help from a map would truly make you a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f7/169_coins_fastest_way.PNG">Gandalf-like wizard</a>. (See more regarding <a href="#Coins">coins</a> below.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Boundaries">Boundaries</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1608:_Hoverboard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: Boundaries">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The larger game world is physically bounded in the left, right, and down directions, with invisible walls to each side and the ground preventing you from going any further down than the deepest depression or hidden caves. In the upward direction there is theoretically also an invisible wall, but while jumping, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> and his hoverboard will appear to continue upwards as long as you jump; in addition, the longer the up arrow is pressed repeatedly, the longer it will take for Cueball to fall down again once the button is released. So, although there are no new things above, you can keep jumping as high as you like and will then fall proportionally longer to get back to where you started out. When the comic was first released, it could have been possible that there were some hidden unexplored parts. Shortly after it was posted, however, a <a href="#Viewers">map</a> was created which covered the entire game.
</p><p>To the far right is a platform at the top of a high pole. This platform turns out to be a nest (like a stork nest).
</p><p>To the far left is a blond woman wearing her hair in a bun, looking right. She tells you about the Destroyer, should you have gone this way without finding it yet.
</p>
<dl><dd>Woman: In the sky, beyond the mountain, I saw a starship.</dd></dl>
<p>The highest straight rise into the air to something other than white is Rock Island, just left of and very high over the Washington monument. Standing on the large rock on top of the Island, you are standing almost as high up as possible (the very top of the bridge on the Destroyer is just a tad higher). There is a coin here one step next to the rock. This is the highest located coin in the game. Going over Rock Island's edge also represents the largest possible drop in the game.
</p><p>As for the deepest parts of the image, the volcano lair and the deep well (halfway to the volcano on the left) are tied. The deepest part where you can stand, however, is in the ocean below the Destroyer where a rogue wave is talking to Cueball:
</p>
<dl><dd>Wave: I know rogue waves seem implausible, but we're a straightforward consequence of the equations of fluid dynamics.</dd>
<dd>Cueball: ... But you can talk?</dd>
<dd>Wave: The equations are really complicated.</dd></dl>
<p>Taking a route through all the extremes mentioned here-- the lowest, highest, leftmost, and rightmost solid positions within the game-- can be done in about 9 minutes and 30 seconds.

<ul><li>Coordinates for the images are given in (X, Y) coordinates with the starting point at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png">(1000, 1074)</a>. </li>
<li>In total there are 3440 images on xkcd that can be accessed via links of this format: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png">http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png</a> [This link is for the (1000, 1074) starting point image.]
<ul><li><b>Here is a page with a table of all the links to images: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard/All_image_links" title="1608: Hoverboard/All image links">All image links</a>.</b></li>
<li><b>Note:</b> This is a large page which may take some time to load.</li></ul></li>
<li>The individual images are so small and cut off at "random" so they do often go straight down through a person, and you can rarely see both a person and the (full) text belonging to them in the same image.
<ul><li>See for instance this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a6/1037x1073y_Wedding.png">wedding scene</a> to the right under the Destroyer, which only makes sense when these four images are put together (as they are in the link): 
<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1037:-1073+s.png">(1037, 1073)</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1037:-1074+s.png">(1037, 1074)</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1038:-1073+s.png">(1038, 1073)</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1038:-1074+s.png">(1038, 1074)</a></li></ul></li>
<li>It will thus not make sense to make a transcript of all individual images, but instead, only of a complete setting (or maybe a part of a setting.)</li></ul></li>
<li>Maximum possible number of images in the x-direction is 180.
<ul><li>Going left will decrease X down to 928 (so 82 pictures left of the starting point in X-direction)</li>
<li>Going right will increase X up to 1107 (so 107 pictures left of the starting point in X-direction)</li></ul></li>
<li>Total number of (possible) images in the y-direction is 44. 
<ul><li>Going down will decrease Y down to 1069 (so 5 pictures down from the starting point in Y-direction)</li>
<li>Going up will increase Y up to 1112 (so 38 pictures up from the starting point in Y-direction)
<ul><li>The "(possible)" is included because the number of possible active Y-images depends on the X-coordinate, as there are several non-existing images that are not just totally white (i.e. blank images), but which does not even have a number/or active link on xkcd. </li>
<li>But the top active image over the floating island and over the top of the bridge section of the Destroyer all have Y coordinate 1112. There are only 20 active images at this Y-coordinate.</li>
<li>The same by the way also goes for the x coordinate. Above X=1076 there are also many non-existing images with not active link.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li> All possible images are thus spread over a 180 x 44 grid, with a possible 7920 images. But 4480 of these images are non-existing on xkcd, but you can travel through them in the game, as they are just shown as completely blank/white empty air in the game.
<ul><li>If you try to load one of the completely blank images like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1077+s.png">(1000, 1077)</a>, three images above the starting point, you will get an error message. There are only 76 (vs 180) images at this Y-coordinate.
<ul><li>Note there are several completely empty/white images that are active, but those can be loaded on xkcd like the one below the missing picture mentioned above: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1076+s.png">(1000, 1076)</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>There are no blank images in completely black areas, like inside structures or underground. And below Y = 1077 all 180 possible Y-images exist for all X-coordinates, from Y = 1069 to 1076. 
<ul><li>For instance, the image below the starting point is completely black <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1073+s.png">(1000, 1073)</a>, and so are the next three below. </li>
<li>The bottom images at Y = 1069 has a white border at the bottom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1069+s.png">(1000, 1069)</a>. </li>
<li>All the images at Y = 1069 are the same except the one at the very right edge because at this edge there is also a white border to the right <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1107:-1069+s.png">(1107, 1069)</a> (this is not the case to the far left at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/928:-1069+s.png">(928, 1069)</a>).</li>
<li>You will never see the images at Y = 1069 in the game. Actually, you will neither see anything of the images with Y = 1070 or 1071. And there is nothing that is not completely black for Y = 1069 to 1072. First from Y = 1073 are there active images which includes white. </li>
<li>This picture with the wave at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1022:-1073+s.png">(1022, 1073)</a> gives the lowest point where the hoverboard Cueball can actually stand. </li>
<li>Since you will sink into the water here, you are almost standing on the top of the Y = 1072 image: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1022:-1072+s.png">(1022, 1072)</a>, which is of course completely black. </li>
<li>In places where you can stand in a low position on Y = 1073 images you will actually see some part of the images with Y = 1072, not that it makes any difference since they are all black.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Here is a list of the places where there are most images at a given X coordinate:
<ul><li>At X = 1078, right under the highest point of the Destroyers bridge <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1078:-1112+s.png">(1078, 1112)</a> there are 36 active images. Thus, even here 8 images are missing between the bottom active image below the Destroyer and the first active near the ground level at Y=1076. (Y = 1077 to 1084 are missing).</li>
<li>These missing Y coordinates are active in other places, for instance under the torpedo rain at X = 1020 where all Y images are active up until 1100 - 32 images. But since the last twelve images above this are missing it is still four less than under the bridge.</li>
<li>Under the floating island, where there are active images at the top Y = 1112, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/990:-1112+s.png">(990, 1112)</a>, there is also the Washington monument below which goes high up, but still there are only 20 active Y images, as there are no active images between 1084 and 1109 (24 missing in between).</li>
<li>Over the volcano's edges the highest images directly connecting to solid ground is found at Y = 1087. One image above this is also active making the height here going up to 1088, thus also making it twenty active Y images. The only <b>not</b> completely white image over the volcano at Y = 1088 is the one with the eagles <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/956:-1088+s.png">(956, 1088)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>It takes 1 minute 52 s to reach from the starting point to the left edge. While we do not have a definite speed for the hoverboard, we can obtain the dimensions of the map by using the Washington monument. Since it is referenced by name, we can assume that the dimension is properly applied. In this case, the monument is 100 pixels tall (when viewed on my photo editor) and the actual monument is 555' meaning that 1 pixel= 5.55'. The whole map is 1920 pixels wide, for a length of 10,656' or 3247.9488m.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The contents of the comic are documented in the <a href="#Table_with_references">table</a> below.
<ul><li>It first goes through the entire image from left to right along the ground
<ul><li>I.e. going up the volcano and down in the lair, down the well and up to the top of the Washington Monument. Only exception so far is that it here goes to the rocky island in the sky. Then it continues right along the ground, only following the wires up to the bottom of the Rebel Runner and then after going over the pyramid it ends up at the far right</li></ul></li>
<li>Then it goes back to the Rebel Runner, and after that follows the torpedoes up to the Star Destroyer-</li>
<li>Finally, it goes through the Star Destroyer from tip to rear in four sections, taking everything within each section top to bottom, before moving on to the next section.</li>
<li>The table can be sorted on all columns, so the above is only valid until any sorting takes place.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the table are the following columns:
<ul><li>Descriptions of the scene depicted in the overview links.
<ul><li>If the scene is a zoomed-out overview that covers the images below this scene's description has been written in <b>bold text</b>.</li>
<li>This can be used as a guide to where in the image the scenes are located.</li>
<li>That is, until any sorting begins.</li></ul></li>
<li>Transcript.
<ul><li>Any text has only been transcribed once. If some scenes overlap, the text has only been written in the first or the one where the text is most central.</li>
<li>Also, any overview that has been zoomed out never has any transcript - these have been listed as (N/A)</li>
<li>Scenes with no text has written (None) in the transcript. </li>
<li>The use of parenthesis for those with no transcript makes it possible to sort on the transcript to get all the scenes with text to the top.</li></ul></li>
<li>Overview links.
<ul><li>There can be more than one, even many, but the first will always be the overview.</li>
<li>If there are secret passages or other situations where it will be interesting to see why the hoverboard can disappear beneath the surface (like in the ocean) then two versions of the images have been included. </li>
<li>The second version is called <i>Hidden passages in red</i> as it has these passages changed to appear in red instead of black.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tile images on xkcd.
<ul><li>For those images that are zoomed to 100% (i.e., not the zoomed-out overviews) there is also a link to the defining image tile on xkcd.</li>
<li>In cases where there is more than one interesting image tile in one scene (maybe because there is actually two or more distinct scenes), there can be one more link in the <i>Other</i> tile column.</li></ul></li>
<li>References.
<ul><li>Three things are referenced many times, and each has their own column so the table can be sorted on these
<ul><li>SW: Star Wars</li>
<li>LOTR: The Lord of the Rings</li>
<li>TE: Thing Explainer</li></ul></li>
<li>Other. There is also a column for "other" types of references so they can also be sorted, without drowning in the three recurring types of references.
<ul><li>These have some further sorting by starting with Comics: or Movies: etc.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Explanations is in the last column.
<ul><li>So far lots of scenes still miss explanations, and some are not complete. </li>
<li>Red text has been used to make this clear. </li>
<li>If updating this and making a good enough explanation delete the red text.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

When it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii#Rediscovery" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pompeii">found again</a> it turned out that people had been surprised by the ash, and thus buried alive. During the excavation, plaster was used to fill in the voids in the ash layers that once held human bodies. This allowed one to see the exact position the person was in when they died. This is what Ponytail wishes for her and Megan, when the volcano they are standing on erupts, a rather morbid wish. She wants their sweet basketball moves to be preserved for eternity. In <i>Playing Fields</i> in TE basketball is mentioned. It is also played on top of the Destroyer close to the bridge. In this case the coin is on top of the basket, but too large to go into the hoop.

<td>These images only cover the part beneath the surface where there is actually still lava, as can be seen in the images where <i>Hidden passages in red</i>. Only the top of the lair below is shown here. From the hidden passage it is here possible to see how to enter this lair. In the images that shows the hidden part the two loose boulders that float (or are outcrops) in the right part of the lake can be seen as well as the two other holes in the lava lakes floor, which all explain why it is easy to get stuck in the lake once you go below the surface and move around. Since everything is black, you do not even know if the game still works and many people may have given up, maybe reloading after not being able to get on with the game.  There is no place in the lake where you can get really stuck, as long as you just push upwards while changing direction from left to right, you are bound to get out sooner or later.

If playing for the first time and becoming uncertain what would happen if the hoverboard touched the lava, the player might actually not even try to go into the lava, thus for certain would miss finding the lair beneath the lava.

The all-time record for downhill racing is not using the ashy slopes on volcanos but from racing on snow, and here the record is not in danger from Ponytail as it is a staggering 138&#160;mph (222&#160;km/h) again with a lesser record for serial produced bikes of 130&#160;mph (210&#160;km/h).

She talks like she is one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Clickbait">clickbait</a> headlines used for getting people to click in on the link generally aimed at generating online advertising revenue, which fits nicely with her recurring theme of as a news anchor. Her daughter is tired of this, especially as it seems like the mother speaks like that all the time. This may embarrass the girl, especially if she is with a friend rather than a brother. Maybe the mother has been reading too many clickbait news on-line? As noted in the other references <i>clickbait</i> is a recurring theme in xkcd. The mother is near a small lake, so it is likely that there is plenty of insects and other bugs. It is possible to sink into the lake as can be seen in the second image with the hidden parts shown in red.

</td>
<td>The book TE was based on the comic <i>Up Goer Five</i> which was about the rocket that took this space capsule to the moon. When it lands it uses three large parachutes to slow down after the main brake-down during reentry. On top of these sits a bird looking like a hen. It is a hen that can think, but it is still not very clever. It believes that this is three eggs, and is amazed that they are already flying before they hatch, which is of course ridiculous, but they do float in the air...
<p>The astronauts inside (two at least, but there should be three if it was one of the moon landing missions) has just been waiting to get close enough to Earth again that they can get a signal on their smart phones. Cueball is even opening the hatch during descend to increase this chance, which would be highly dangerous. Also normally they would land in water (which will though not be the case this time). The reason he does this is that they wish to know how many more likes they (and their mission) has received during the reentry. This would have been relevant if the moon landings had taken place today. There where no social media or internet back in 1969. This is similar to the Cueball who is trapped in the lava lair without connection to Twitter.

<td>At the bottom of the well in the water (see also the hidden passages image) is a girl. Above to the left of her is a coin. Maybe thrown in by Cueball at the top. Ghost living in wells is a common theme, for instance there is a Japanese movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banch%C5%8D_Sarayashiki" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Banchō Sarayashiki">Banchō Sarayashiki</a> whose <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202946/releaseinfo">English title</a> is <i>Ghost in the Well</i>. So, this is why this real girl explains that she is actually not a ghost, she just like wells and thus likes to sit in the cold water at the bottom of wells. This could be very dangerous, and she will probably have a hard time getting up. It is also a very deep well, so falling into this well might very well be lethal. There are also many stories (in this case also real stories like the one about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McClure" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jessica McClure">Jessica McClure</a>) about kids that fall into wells, some of them surviving being stuck for several days in the wells. Also, in movies this story is often used, for instance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Begins" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a> the young Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a fear of bats.

<td>Megan has managed to land her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-wing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:X-wing">x-wing</a> fighter from the rebel fleet in Star Wars right next to a standard gas station. And she has planned to fill her spaceship up. That it could run on petrol for cars seems highly unlikely. The question is if she has already filled it up and is heading back with the handle to the gas stander, or if she has just discovered that the hose is not long enough to reach all the way under the wing to the fighter. It will have taken considerable skills to land this close to the station without hitting the cover over the stander. Ponytail is sitting in the shop with a coin. This is the first coin to be discovered when going left from the play-area. There is a long stretch without coins to begin with. The coins on the rock island in the sky it on this stretch, but so far above that most people would miss them altogether. There is also a coin with two birds straight above the right wing on the X-wing. But about three jumps up, so it is easy to miss. To get into the shop you need to go over the stander and back. Why Cueball have crawled up in the roof is not clear. But maybe he is enjoying the view over the cliff that is to the right of the station. There is a stop sign to the left, but there seems to be no road that way. Maybe that is why you should stop...

First when the coin has been taken, can the string between the birds be seen (see the other image). The birds are three jumps above the X-wing below, and this coin is thus easily missed by the players. In the film the horses are simulated with the sound of two coconuts shells being hit together. Someone asks how they happened to be in England and there is discussion about migratory birds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallows" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Swallows">swallows</a> and the possibility that they have brought the coconuts along with them. But the consensus is that they cannot do this by themselves the coconut being too heavy, but then it is suggested that two swallows could carry it on a string between them. Later in the film someone is seen actually tying two birds together to a coconut. In this comic, we now know how the coins have been transported through the image...

<td>Cueballs lines is from The Lion King and has been used directly before in the comic Opportunity. Randall has made several references to the film in xkcd, and it is obvious that he was very affected by this film that came out when he was just the right age.
<p>Cueball is talking to a child version of Ponytail, whose mother may be the one climbing up the cliff side below. The first three lines of the quote goes as in the film, but then it turns out that the girl is properly referring to the Star Destroyer that would be clearly visible from this cliff as it covers almost the entire right part of this world from just beyond the play-area. (They do not look high enough to see the rock island in the sky, and it would also not cast shadow over an entire region.) As it is not certain players coming here have already been to the right to see the Destroyer it is not necessarily clear that the reply from Cueball should apply to the Destroyer. But if it does then it would be the Emperor Palpatine that he refers to as God. The emperor is on board the Destroyer near the bridge at the very top rear end of the spaceship and has God like powers. It could however also just be a general reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:God">God</a> and thus be inferred as if God cast a shadow over an entire region (country). Maybe just in general as if he has a place in the sky that cast a shadow (like sitting on a cloud). Alternatively, it could be the people who believe too much in any God, which can be viewed as living under a shadow, as they will not try to see any reality if it does not fit with their religious beliefs.

<td>At the base of the Washington Monument Megan and Cueball is looking up at it, and Cueball complains that it doesn't even look like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>. By "Washington" he could be referring to the city of Washington DC or to the real Washington monument, but he is probably referring to the first US President George Washington, since monuments often depict (look like) the person they are dedicated to, but the real Washington monument is not meant to look like Washington himself. Cueball seems to have expected all presidential monuments to include a statue of the honored president and is confused and disappointed when the monument fails to meet his expectations. Of course, since this is the only Washington based building in the game it is true that the place doesn't look like the city. If he refers to the monument, then it can be questioned if this is because the monument is not an exact replica (in proportions and/or scale). In any case it is clearly meant as an indicator that this is supposed to look like the monument, and with the tip's apex being made of aluminum (see that scene) as on the real monument, there can be no doubt what is referenced. It is possible to get to the left side of the monument without going up to see the tip, if the player immediately understands the sign with the white arrow that points to a hidden passage through the base of the monument, as can be seen in the second image with the hidden passages shown in red.
<p>To the left of the monument there is a flagpole with a blown-out flag. It is all black, but it should be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Flag of the United States">the Stars and Stripes</a> as there are fifty flag poles with the US flag (one for each <a href="/wiki/index.php/1653:_United_States_Map" title="1653: United States Map">state</a>) surrounding the monument in a circle. On top of the pole there sits a duck looking left. Towards the end of the world to the left on top of the left volcanic rim there also sits a similar duck looking right.

So Cueball and White Hat will not become rich based on the metal value. Of course, if they did steal the tip of such a famous monument, they might actually be able to sell it to a scrupulous collector at a value comparable to if was just a lump of silver of that weight.
<p>White Hat looking over his shoulder spots the Star Destroyer and thus help guide a player that has started going left towards the Destroyer to the right. How they have managed the climb, getting the ropes over the tip, or how Cueball intends to get down with the tip is left to the readers imagination...

The rock in the game is very hard to find by chance, it is kind of unobtainable, which may be a further reference to the film since the reason the rocks do float is a combination of a weak gravity, a strong magnetic field and a mineral whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Superconductivity">superconductive properties</a> allow it to float in magnetic fields. Of course, the levitating Hallelujah Mountains in the film contain significant quantities of the mineral which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtanium" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Unobtanium">Unobtanium</a>. Only thing pointing towards it is the Washington Monument and even if you go up from there, pushing the up arrow continuously for more than half a minute you may almost miss it, as only the far-right girl would move through the view. And with two coins around this island, it is important to find it in order to get all coins. Apart from the coins and the surprise there is little of interest here, and not even any spoken text.
<p>To the right just beneath the rear end of the Destroyer there is a small lump of earth that has floated up from the ground, hovering over the corresponding hole in the ground. Maybe this is caused by the same force that have created this floating island.

There is even some extra text telling you to <i>Use arrow keys to move</i> but as soon as you do, this text disappears, just like the <a href="#Messages_in_Play_Area">message you can receive</a> below in the view depending on your action in this area. The text below the starting point of the hoverboard Cueball that you control, explains that the game is released on this day to celebrate the release of Randall's new book <a href="/wiki/index.php/Thing_Explainer" title="Thing Explainer">Thing Explainer</a> and thus directly references the book. And also explains why this comic has been made, and furthermore why it was released on a Tuesday rather than the usual Wednesday release, which was then skipped this week. It also explains that if you collect coins, you can deposit them at the terminal, and when you do it list the score (number of coins and the time used) and rates your achievement. By noting that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7e/17_coins.PNG">you got all the coins</a> if you collect all seventeen coins in the play area maze, then it is one more trick to try to make you stay inside the walls of the maze. There is only one small feature that can be spotted from within the maze that breaks the symmetry and may give away the clue of the game. And that is the small stone that lies on the ground to the left. Because why should it be there, if this was just a platform/maze game. The walls cannot be seen if you stay in or just around the outer wall of the maze. But if you go to them, you may think this is the end. Another detail about the game to be learned already here is that there can be "solid" black parts of the surroundings which are not solid at all. This can be seen in the image showing the hidden passages in red. Here it can be seen that the ledge beneath the two inverted parenthesis " )( " is not solid, and that you can fall or jump up through this section. This could forewarn you of the hidden passages, especially to the lair beneath the volcano which are the only real hidden place based on hidden passages, but also for those in the Washington Monument and in the cotton trap in the Destroyer and the glitch floor also on the Destroyer.

<td>The small forest with two large trees and several small ones is the first really interesting to show up if exiting the play area to the right for the first time and finally a person actually speaking shows up (although Cueball at the base of the Washington Monument to the right would be closer). Megan is not saying much, but she is clearly reacting to something. It could be to one or both the space ships above her. Since the Destroyer is already on top of her, as the front end of that ship is just short of being above the right wall of the play area, then it could also be the Rebel Runner she is pointing out. No matter what, following her arm going up and right it is likely that the runner will enter the view, but it is possible to miss it, in which case there would be a long way up to the Destroyer. Megan and Cueball is standing on the edge of a cliff, offering them an excellent view. Stepping down on the plateau below the cliff takes the player close to the lowest possible level to be at in the game. There are no tiles with any white below that level (1073). But the lowest point is first in the Ocean.

This should not be physically possible as the ropes do not seem to be attached to the ground, at least not the one to the left. But there can be no doubt that the drawing shows her standing with both feet on the rope. She is thus not helping Cueball. From here it is not yet known to the player that it is the Rebel Runner they have caught (with anchors) above, but when this becomes clear it will also be clear that they have no chance of holding on to the space ship. But here it seems they are doing a great job. The ground is barren between these wires and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tumbleweed">tumbleweed</a> is blowing along to make this even more clear.

The other two wires comes up to a cannon close to an entrance, where Cueball is fishing birds with a crumb of bread or a cracker on the end of the hook. (The bird fishing scene is also depicted when going through the Runner <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">down below</a>).

Although it is not their main target they can also be used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_waves" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Surface waves">surface waves</a> which would be like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rogue wave">rogue wave</a> in this scene. This kind of waves is also known as freak waves, monster waves etc. They are large and spontaneous surface waves that occur far out in open water and can be extremely dangerous. But as the wave describes to Cueball these big waves can be predicted from the equations in fluid dynamics. Of course, Cueball is less afraid of the wave (even though it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(vagrant)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rogue (vagrant)">rouge</a>), than he is fascinated by the fact that it speaks. The wave just replies that the equations are really complicated. That this is the case was for instance part of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1315:_Questions_for_God" title="1315: Questions for God">1315: Questions for God</a> where a famous quote regarding turbulent motion of fluids is mentioned. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Turbulence">Turbulence</a> is also described by fluid dynamics, so they are part of the equations and the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Lamb#Career" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Horace Lamb"> quote</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Lamb" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Horace Lamb">Horace Lamb</a> was: "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Quantum electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a>, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic." He turned out to be correct as nowadays we have a much clearer understanding of QED, while our understanding of turbulence has improved little. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, who was himself largely responsible for explaining QED, famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Turbulence">described turbulence</a> as "the most important unsolved problem of classical physics". So who knows if these formulas could describe a talking wave? A coin crowns the wave.

<p>There is a coin inside the ruin beneath Cueball who sits on top of the ruin, and both sings the song and plays the guitar. Megan just stands inside the ruin at ground level and listens. It is not difficult to get to the coin, but there is only entrance into the little coin room between the ledge under Cueball and the ceiling of the lower room. But it is possible to walk directly in them from the left. Maybe the ruin is in this state of affair because the spiders have crossed the ocean just to the left, the shore of this can be seen at the edge of the scene. But there is no indication of any spiders anywhere else in the comic, in spite of the many animals throughout the comic.

<td>Megan, in a black wedding dress, and Cueball, with a tie, is married by a female priest in front of a crowd of five sitting in chairs in front of them. In the crowd there are yet another Cueball, Hairy and Ponytail, but the last two are not the familiar versions in xkcd: one has a cap on backwards and then a person (M/W?) with black. Just before a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wedding">wedding</a> it is sometimes customary to ask if any in the crowd could give a cause why these two people should not be wed. What is not customary is to threaten those who do have any objections that they would then have to plead these in front of the great gangster boss from Star Wars, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>. In case he has condoned this wedding, you may end up pleading for him to kill you mercifully if you did object anyway. The normal form of the priest's question goes more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/marriage.pdf">like this</a>: "If any of you can show just cause why they may not lawfully be married, speak now; or else for ever hold your peace." (See the top of page 4 of the pdf file in the link (page 424) and a discussion about this sentences use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=635317">in real life</a>).
<p>Beyond the wedding, another Megan is sitting on a large boulder facing the wedding, and behind her a third Cueball is having a picnic with a second Ponytail. The question here is if Megan looks at the wedding or turns her back to the picnic. Depending if the player went right along the ground to begins with and saw the wedding first or went through the Destroyer and came back the other way and saw the picnic first the players preconceptions on these questions may be completely different. In either case it still looks like Megan would have liked to be with Cueball (either the one in the tie or the one at the picnic. Of course, with characters drawn "randomly" in many places she may bot even belong to either scene. Standing on the rock with Megan hoverboard Cueball cannot see either of the scenes, but standing between Megan and either scene, she can be seen together with either of the relevant Cueball and another girl. In the first case with the wedding, she might have wished she had the courage to speak up in spite of the Jabba threat. In the other case she may feel rejected by the happy picnic couple and has turned her back to them. Poor Megan. Ponytail and Cueball seems to enjoy their picnic lunch in the open air though.

<td>It is so common to have your motto translated into the dead language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Latin">Latin</a> that there even is an entire category for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Latin_mottos" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Category:Latin mottos">Latin mottos</a> on Wikipedia. Since no one really speaks the language anymore, and only few learn it well enough to just read any sentence, by doing so you actually hide this motto that you probably would like to tell people about. The only Latin that has entered popular usage are generally idioms, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Carpe diem">Carpe diem</a> (seize the day), etc. (et cetera, meaning "and the rest"). However, most of the time, like the one Megan is explaining to her friend, it would make much more sense to just write it in your native language (English in this case); but then of course there would be no need for a motto, where you ask yourself why you are speaking Latin. In this way, the joke is quite self-referential. There is also a cemetery in Click and Drag.
<p>The Latin in the motto is not correct, but close, and it could both be Randall's accidental errors or purposeful errors (as there are probably many "private" mottoes out there that are not completely correct. <br /> The original sentence:
</p><p><b>Cur</b> - why. <br /><b>Ego</b> - I.<br /><b>Committitur</b> - can be translated as "start", but is incorrectly conjugated; in view of the proper translation, a more acceptable word would be "commisi".<br /><b>Dictar</b> - likely a misspelling of "dictare", an acceptable translation of "to speak". <br /><b>Latinae</b> - Latin, but in the wrong case; a more correct translation would probably be "Latinam".<br />A possible translation of this sentence is therefore "Why did I start to speak Latin?". The word <i>just</i> is completely missing and could have been included by using <i>modo</i>. However, Megan could have added it to make it more "natural" in English. In this way, the family motto given here is a slightly misused satirical statement on Latin family mottoes.

The two Cueballs check out an inscription at the foot (<a href="/wiki/index.php/559:_No_Pun_Intended" title="559: No Pun Intended">pun intended</a>) of a monument. Typically old relics from the past has been demolished, and if only part of a human body is displayed (at least when it is not just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bust (sculpture)">bust</a> supposed to only have head and shoulders), then it is often assumed that the rest of the statue has been lost. Just like the missing arms of the ancient Greek statue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_de_Milo" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Venus de Milo">Venus de Milo</a>. These arms were there originally. But as it turns out as Cueball reads the transcription someone in the past just wished to show the future his huge foot. Suggesting that this is either actual size, or just that he was very proud of at least one of his feet. He also mocks anyone reading the inscription by calling them the derogating word <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dirtbag">dirtbags</a>. This is a recent work so if this were an ancient monument it would be highly unlikely that it said that. Of course, it could be Cueballs translation of what is actually written, or as this is not necessarily old, it is not just part of the original monument but the entire unbroken statue of a foot, then it could be a contemporary artist who made it. However, it is just in front of the pyramid to the right, and in front of the real pyramid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Khafre" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pyramid of Khafre">Pyramid of Khafre</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sphinx_of_Giza" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Great Sphinx of Giza">Great Sphinx of Giza</a>, also much larger than life size lies. (It has lost its nose by the way). So, this could be the games version of such a large statue in front of a pyramid.
<p>As from the scene to the left of this giant foot, the inscription that Cueball reads is probably in Latin, in which case it could have read something along the lines of: <i>Io, de futuro sacculo terra! Reprehendo sicco meus ingens radices!</i> (which could be translated back to <i>Io, for the future of the bag, earth Check out my huge foot!</i>, since there were no words for <i>Yo dirtbags</i> in Latin.

Anything right of the start of the hole is no longer under the Destroyer, which anything else right of the play area until this hole has been.

It has four rooms (one blown open), a small cannon room that cannot be entered by the hoverboard and two corridors. The rear is the large engines. There are three coins. There is a clear symmetry along the center, as the two cannons and the two parabolic antennas are placed symmetrical on the top and bottom hull, and also the curve of the hull is symmetric. In the second image link the way to find the runner from the ground via the wires can be seen (six coins). And in the third the way to find the Destroyer above via the torpedoes can be seen (14 coins). The Destroyer is thus not hidden, like for instance the Floating Rock Island or the Hidden Lair beneath the lava lake, and there are many less direct indications that there is a runner from all the people who comment on them or even directly or indirectly point the way to the Destroyer. The Runner is supposed to be 150 m long.

<td>The bridge of the Rebel Blockade Runner is crammed with interesting scenes. First on the bridge itself a long-haired woman (the captain) is mocking both Star Wars and Star Trek fans alike by using the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcRX0Gw1aaw">opening line</a> from the Star Trek series about stating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stardate">stardate</a> for the captain's log on board the first spaceship ever shown in the Star Wars franchise. Hairbun behind her (it could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a> who also has buns but above each ear) is clearly distressed by this "mistake". This could either be because she is a Star Wars fan that dislike Star Trek or because the stardate used is the real date, November 24, 2015, on which the comic was released (as well as the book <i>Thing Explainer</i>) instead of using the normal convention for stardates with a four or five digit number plus a decimal like 1513.1. Given that the long-haired woman has the appearance of <a href="/wiki/index.php/Danish" title="Danish">Danish</a>, this may be intentionally rather than a mistake. There is another reference to the Star Trek universe in the scene where the torpedoes are fired from the Destroyer above, so no less than two Trek infiltrations in the opening scene of Star Wars.
<p>Beneath the bridge there is a smaller room where Ponytail and Megan spoofs <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X69NCLxwLEY">Luke's Lightsaber Training</a> from the original Star Wars movie where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> practices under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kenobi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ben Kenobi">Ben Kenobi</a>'s guidance while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Han Solo">Han Solo</a> comes with snide remarks. Ponytail (in Luke's place) holds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> above which floats a sphere which represents the small remote controlled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jedi">Jedi</a> training device from that scene. Megan both guides like Ben and comments like Han. She holds some kind of cannon that she obviously loads with T-shirts from the box behind her. As she tells Ponytail, a true Jedi trains with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgCz7C6jEIk">t-shirt cannon</a>. Han Solo's quote begins like it but ends quite differently: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOuCbDkKIs4">Good against remotes is one thing good against the living it's something else</a>. He would also prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(Star_Wars)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Blaster (Star Wars)">blaster</a> as he explains: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V268Qk6-xsw">Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid</a>. There is a coin behind Ponytail.
</p><p>Above the bridge there is a hatch open where hoverboard Cueball may enter and a Cueball is standing behind the hatch looking down along the hull.
</p><p>There are cannons both above and below the hull, the one on top has a coin in front of the barrel. There is a similar cannon with a coin in front on top of the Destroyer. Beneath this cannon is a tiny room where another Cueball is pouring several small bullets from a bucket into a black box labeled bullets (for the cannon). From this room there is a small shaft down to the main corridor in the Runner. But this shaft is too slim for hoverboard Cueball to pass up through it, or rather for the board to get in. Cueball can pass into the hole, but the board holds him back from reaching up in the small room. The cannon below has two of the anchors from the wires going to the ground attached around its barrel. The third anchor is stuck in the bottom hull further down the hull. It is unclear how this last has become attached to the hull!
</p><p>In the corridor that runs away from the bridge a small robot on wheels drive towards left. Similar types of robots are often seen in the Star Wars universe and there is also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/1608_1034x1091y_Torpedo_canon_below_Destroyer.png">another robot</a> looking like two of these on top of each other in the Destroyer above where the torpedoes connecting them ends up. Further down the corridor Ponytail is walking to the right while singing indicated with two notes.
</p><p>Above the cannon at the bottom of the hull on a ledge with an entry to the ship is a third Cueball holding a fishing rod out over the ledge, so the hook hangs in the air. Maybe he is fishing for either of the two birds that are flying around the line. What appears to be a loaf of bread or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/58/1608_1014x1078y_Three_wires_and_reaching_up_to_anchors_in_Runner.png">a cracker is attached to the hook</a> at the end of the line.

<td>The reference to the Death Star plans is from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/yHfLyMAHrQE?t=340">the opening scene</a> in the first Star Wars movie. The sentence uttered by First Cueball is said by a Storm Trooper to Darth Vader. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes?qt=qt0440708">rest of the quote</a> is not quite like in the comic. Rather is goes like this:
<dl><dd>Darth Vader: [addressing the Tantive IV's captain, whom he is interrogating] Where are those transmissions you intercepted? WHAT have you DONE with those plans?</dd>
<dd>Captain Antilles: We intercepted no transmissions... This is a consular ship... We're on a diplomatic mission...</dd>
<dd>Darth Vader: [shouting] If this is a consular ship, WHERE is the ambassador?</dd>
<dd>Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! </dd></dl>
<p>The comic jokes with the way Darth Vader seems to assume that if the plans had been found on the computer, then no one else would have had access to them. The second Cueball, although not Vader, represents a superior that have absolutely no idea about how computers work, in spite of his insistence that he actually do. If the data has once been intercepted, they could have been shared or copied to several other computers or devices or even been printed. By finding them in the main computer they would only make sure that they were indeed intercepted, but not be certain that they have not been delivered to the rebel base.
</p><p>The other two Cueballs on top of the ship stand over a hole in the hull going into a small room above and left of the large room. It seems that the fourth Cueball has made this hole directly from the outside (i.e. it is not caused by an exploding torpedo from the Destroyer above). Because he confirms when the third Cueball asks if he just came down to make the hole without permission. The third Cueball thinks this is rude. This is, of course, hilarious as if a space pirate or any other attacker of a spaceship would ask permission before attacking. And also, the idea that he might get permission for asking is likewise crazy. To call this rude is also a weird way to look at such an attack. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3PO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:C3PO">C3PO</a> uses <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWoG9tKf1lA">this as reply</a> to a comment made to him by a similar droid in the second movie.

<td>In this overview of the top rear of the hull of the Runner, there are four scenes with two persons in each, with no less than six Cueballs. Beginning with the scene to the far left the two first Cueballs discuss what type of Star Destroyer is shooting at their ship from above them. They are clearly tilting their head far back to look up. The first Cueball comments on how huge it is and asks if it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Destroyer#Imperial_class" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Destroyer"><i>Imperial</i> class</a> Destroyer. "<i>Imperial</i> class" is the designation of the Destroyer <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Devastator">Devastator</a></i> that followed the Rebel Runner <i>Tantive IV</i> in the opening scene. There is also and more than 10 times as large version called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Destroyer#Super_Star_Destroyer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Destroyer">Super Star Destroyer</a>, which were featured in the two sequels in the original trilogy. But even the original Star Destroyers were improved during the movies, so when the improved Destroyers came out, they became known as (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Imperial_II-class_Star_Destroyer">Mark II</a>, Mk-II or plainly II, and the original (as Devastator) became known as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Imperial_I-class_Star_Destroyer">Mk-1</a>. The second Cueball agrees with the first and suggest that it is a Mk-1 and thus makes it even more clear that this scene is actually the opening scene of the original Star Wars movie. But then again, he continues, it depends weather this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_universe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars expanded universe">expanded universe</a> (now known as <i>Star Wars Legends</i>) where all  authorized media (books etc.) released based on the Star Wars franchise should be counted in, or if it is only the movies sanctioned directly by George Lucas (and now Disney). What he says is that in all those works there could be so many other types os ships mentioned, that he could mistake for a Mk-1, that in that universe he would not be certain at all. But in the "official" universe he would claim that it was a Mk-1 <i>Imperial</i> class Star Destroyer.
<p>In the next scene Ponytail and a third Cueball fight with bows and arrows against the Destroyers 100+ torpedoes raining down from above. Ten of these can be seen falling, one hits the ship, and one has just exploded in a big <i>boom</i>, to be compared with the feeble <i>twang</i> made by Cueballs bow when he fires the arrow. When later discovering how far there is up to the bottom of the Destroyer it only becomes even more silly.
</p><p>In the third scene two more Cueballs (four and five) look up at the torpedoes falling down in an arch over their heads. The fourth Cueball asks why they still keep firing. And the fifth Cueball tries to explain. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_turret" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gun turret">turret</a> is generally a weapon mount that houses the crew and a projectile-firing weapon and lets the weapon be aimed and fired in a given cone of fire. So, it is this crew, that are the turret operators. There is also such <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">an operator</a> on the Rebel Runner below the top cannon (or turret), in the scene with the bridge. The reason they keep fighting is given that they just do their own thing and that is annoying. This indicates that these two Cueballs do no longer think that the Destroyer needs to fire anymore on the Runner, and thus also indicates that they are part of the crew from the Destroyer send down to take over the Runner. Thus, it is annoying that the shooting has not stopped as it puts them in danger. If they belong to the Runner, then they would not think it weird that the shooting continued. It turns out to be Megan who is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/1608_1034x1091y_Torpedo_canon_below_Destroyer.png">turret operator in the Destroyer</a>! At least they can be happy that it is regular torpedoes. (See the explanation of the scene regarding the Torpedo cannon below Destroyer).
</p><p>In the final scene at the very end of the hull is the sixth Cueball together with Megan. She holds on to him as he tries to toast a giant marshmallow on a stick by holding it in front of the exhaust pipe of the Runner. This would most likely melt the marshmallow instantaneously... In <i>Red world space car</i> in TE the Mars rower also toasts a marshmallow on a stick over a small fire.

<td>The 12 last torpedoes lead up to the cannon below the Destroyer that has fired them all towards the runner far below. In the control room (or turret room see explanation of scene where the torpedoes hit the Runner) is Megan and Cueball. She explains that she used regular torpedoes rather than the much more powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek#Projectile_weapons" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Weapons in Star Trek"><b>photon</b> torpedoes</a>. This may cheat some to think this is a reference to the weapon Luke Skywalker used when destroying the Death Star in the original Star Wars movie. But they were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_weapons#Ship-mounted" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of Star Wars weapons"><b>proton</b> torpedoes</a>. Photon torpedoes are a standard ship-based weapon armed with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Antimatter">antimatter</a> warhead and one of those alone would probably take a ship like the Runner out if it was not shielded... However, they are used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Starship Enterprise">Starship Enterprise</a> in the Star Trek universe. So, this is the second (but more subtle) mixing of the two competing franchises connected with the torpedoes in the opening scene of Star Wars. The first being on the bridge of the Runner below. Above the control room there is a shaft up to a corridor in which a small robot of the types typically seen on spaceships in Star Wars is seen. There is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png">similar robot</a> down in the Runner but only half this one's height.

This first corridor leads to a playpen pit filled with playpen balls, which is a recurring subject in xkcd. Cueball and Megan is adult sized (i.e. as big as hoverboard Cueball) and it is thus a clear reference to Grownups. There could be water down below the balls as a fish is seen jumping out over the surface. But given that there are no splashes from the balls Cueball throws in the air, it could also just be a gimmick by Randall. To have something like this in a Star Destroyer kind of ruins the mood surrounding these war machines. Something seen several times throughout the spaceship.

Children usually hits the piñata with a club until it breaks and falls down revealing candy or toys inside.

But to do it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> would defeat the purpose of this game as it will go right through the piñata on contact thus spilling the contest out on the floor in the first go. The Cueball with the lightsaber can thus confidently say that he got this. But it seems like the other Cueball is trying to stop him and that Hairy, holding the club they were intended to use, puts a hand protectively on Megan. A lightsaber would be a very dangerous weapon and should not be used lightly in a playful setting. As a side note any candy/toy in the path of the ligtsaber as it passes through the piñata will melt/burn immediately. Lightsaber noises are mentioned in the title text of the Christmas Settings comic coming out shortly after this one.

<td>Another enjoyable activity to attend to by adults is located here in the front sections of the Destroyer: A swimming pool. Don't worry about Ponytail jumping head first into the water, as can be seen in the hidden passage image it is rather deep. Cueball and Megan is already in. Supposedly there is a rung ladder up again on the side, but it cannot be seen in this slice through the Destroyer. A coin hangs in the top corner of the room. When standing with the hoverboard on the bottom of the pool it will be possible to see that there is a coin on the outside of the hull in the indentation in the hull below the pool. From the outside, however, it will not be possible to see that there is a pool above as the water is the same black (to the eye) as the solid hull.

<p>The centre contains a small room with a stick figure wearing a tonsure haircut (where only the top of the head is shaved bald), a potted plant, and a coin. The plant resembles a pea plant, and the tonsure is a haircut associated with monks, so this is likely to be Gregor Mendel. Mendel was a 19th century Czech monk who discovered the principles of genetic inheritance by crossing strains of pea plants.

The shaft up is the only way to move further down inside the Destroyer without moving over or under the hull.
<p>Its appearance in the Star Destroyer with the coin makes it superficially similar to a holoprojector, with the coin as the holorgram - it is unclear whether this is the intended meaning, however.

The hull is not far away, and the car room is right where one of the large steps in the upper hull appears. Right outside there are two coins at the bottom and top of the step. These cannot be seen from inside the room. There is no fast way to get outside from here, and actually no easy way to get a car into this room either. In <i>Sky Toucher</i> in TE there is also a car stuck in the middle of the skyscraper a long way from the parking cellar.

Though in the case with the Destroyer and Runner they did not go inside the atmosphere as depicted here in the comic, in the scene from the original Star Wars movie. The blonde woman comes with a comment typical for b-moves, who cares if this would work in real life, it is just a film.

<td>The corridor from the room with Megan and the car is long. In the middle of it there is a shaft going up (a long way). Just inside this shaft Ponytail is seen flying up, hands in front of her like another Superman. Above her in the shaft there is a coin. This is not the only place in the comic where Ponytail is flying. Although here it seems like an automatic thing (like Superman), whereas down below on the ground below the Destroyer she has to flap her arms violently, but then actually manages to take off from the ground. In a spaceship like this Destroyer there could both be a system to let people float upwards, some gravitational effects or just plain effects of the flying itself, whereas down on the ground flying like that would be magic for sure. But at least there seems to be some correlation since it is Ponytail that flies in both cases.

It seems like they are making a trap, which is even more likely seeing that the bottom of the pit has six sharp spikes that would likely impale any unlucky victims that fell in. Alternatively (given the words Cueball uses), they have made this hole by mistake, and now tries to cover it so no one sees it. If he meant it to be a trap, he might instead have phrased it, "so they won't see it until it is too late". The kid looks like the kid in the room at the rotary, as they have the same hairdo.

<td>With the comment from Hairbun about peristalsis - the bowel movement getting food etc. through the digestive system, and with the three chambers with coins above a colon like structure, leading into the corridor with these motions, with a coin both going down the colon and through the peristalsis, there can be no doubt that this is the digestive system for this "living" spaceship, and coins is what it lives off. This interpretation can further be extended to the very front end, where there is the appearance of a head that eats coins (see the front-end overview) and at the rear end a coin is bouncing out at the very last shaft before the very end of the ship. Suggesting where this animal gets rid of the waste products afterwards. (The rest of the ship is not part of this interpretation).

This is the kind of muscle movements that causes food to move through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Human gastrointestinal tract">human gastrointestinal tract</a>. Hairbun is telling Cueball that this is indeed corridor peristalsis, so a way for the corridor to move stuff along. As there are coins at both end of this section it is quite clear that these coins are moved along by the corridor itself. The indentation of the corridor is so strong that the corridor is not wide enough to allow hoverboard Cueball to pass through. So, to get both coins another route needs to be found. The shortest way is to go up the shaft behind Hairbun, passing the two empty rooms with coins on the way to the top of the Destroyers hull. To get to the other side hoverboard Cueball will then have to pass through the Destroyers colon like structure to the right. See below. As mentioned in the overview above this is a clear reference to the human digestive system, or in this case the Destroyers ditto.

The three coins around the cotton trap is almost connected by the cotton, as can be seen in the next overview where the hidden passage through the cotton is clearly marked in red. As can be seen there is a very deep black hole beneath the surface of the cotton (which Ponytail states is cotton). From the bottom of the cotton trap going left will lead to a hidden entrance to the top of the spark gap room. Going right will lead to the hidden entrance to the corridor with traps going to the left entrance to the cave. There are coins on each exit as well as just above the cotton to the right. The third image is a further zoom out to show the entire surroundings of the cotton trap room. (And the last is with the cotton etc. turned red). Here the traps in the corridor leading to the cave can be seen as well as the opening into the cave. Below that the strange spiral corridor can be seen. Both these scenes will be described below in the cave section. To the left the shaft and corridors that connect the two rooms even if not noticing the hidden passage can be seen. It is the corridor with the trap covered by Cueball and the shaft where Ponytail flies up. Three more coins are visible in this wider zoom out for a total of nine coins in this area. The two rooms will be described in further detail below. All of the rooms that can be entered through the cotton trap can also be entered through different entrances from other routes. This means that failing to find out how the cotton trap works, will not prevent the player in reaching either the spark gap from below or the cave to the right.

<td>Entering this room along the top corridor reveals Ponytail standing at the beginning of a steep descend. She clearly warns the player about a trap made of cotton. As can be seen in the hidden passage image most of the black at the bottom of the descend is not solid floor but a hidden passage. Given Ponytails comment it must be assumed to be made of cotton. Given that hoverboard Cueball is not affected by the cotton and can move either up again, or out left or right it is not a trap for him. But other unlucky persons falling into the cotton might not be as lucky. If this is not a trap in itself, there are several traps if moving out to the right (where the coin is below the cotton level). This corridor goes to the cave, but first after passing five traps. See more about the entire surroundings in the overview scenes above.

<td>The bottom of the cotton trap is a dark place. But as can be seen in the red hidden passage image it is possible to move both left and right to get out. In either case a coin can be obtained at the exit. The left exit leads to a shaft going into the spark gap room below, and the right exit leads through a corridor with traps into the cave. Going up in the spark gap room below will clearly reveal the shaft up. But if the cotton trap has not been discovered at this time, it is likely that the player will not attempt to breech the wall and would thus fail to enter the cotton trap from below. The coin could easily seem enough reason for this dead-end shaft above the room.

<td>This room is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_gap" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spark gap">spark gap</a> room, because there seems to be a spark between the two large electrode like structures marked JS. Cueball is watching this, maybe he is the evil inventor that has created this device. At least another Cueball is climbing high above him up on the wall to the left, and when the player passes him on his hoverboard he asks the player no to talk about him (<i>shh</i>). It is unclear if he is sneaking away, spying, or sneaking down to attack the other Cueball. A coin is hidden behind the spark gap, but as the spark gap is of the "red" type of black hoverboard Cueball can pass without problems into the coin. As can be seen in the other image displaying the lower part of this scene, the coin outside of the hull is close by, and actually the two coins above each other down there are in the same small image (see the first of the small images).

<td>This is the corridor exiting the cotton trap room (with a coin as mentioned previously), see the cotton in the hidden passage in red image. The corridor leads to the cave, but to get there five traps has to be passed. First there are four hammers with jagged edges that opens and closes with much force as perceived by the noises. And then a pit with a fire has to be surpassed. Of course, as can be seen in the "red" image, neither of these traps are any problem for hoverboard Cueball as they are all of the red type of black. But it is a clear indication that the player is about to enter some interesting place, which is true as the cave is one of the most interesting places in the Destroyer. Although there are two other ways to get into the cave, it is by far the most interesting way to enter the cave for the first time!

It is somewhat unusual that this is on the bottom, since these cannons are generally on top though they are all over the ship, and there are turrets on the bottom of the First Order star destroyer in Force Awakens. Also, the shape is more reminiscent of a real tank gun than the squarer turrets in Star Wars, though this is probably just an effect of Randall's drawing style, rather than anything significant.

Similar systems are referenced in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1737:_Datacenter_Scale" title="1737: Datacenter Scale">1737: Datacenter Scale</a>. This system is generally used in large server rooms, where a room with fire will be sealed off from the rest of the servers, and the inert gas will flow into the room, extinguishing the fire, at the cost of whatever was in the room. Since this could be deadly these systems are only legal in rooms with little or no human interaction. The character on the left (Possibly Megan with hair buns) starts off by describing this system, though the system on the star destroyer has the key difference of piping in oxygen, instead of nitrogen, which Ponytail questions. Megan responds "Uhh, <i>Boring</i>." which is technically true. An Inert gas will have a little visible effect, and the fire will slowly die. Piping in oxygen, however, is not a valid way to extinguish flames, as it would feed the fire instead of extinguishing it, though, if you have an adequate seal, this might not be as much of a problem as it sounds. The fire will eventually consume all of the oxygen and die. Unfortunately, there are 3 problems with this. The first is simple: there are people on a star destroyer, and this system will kill them if they happen to be near the fire. The second is that in addition to simply feeding the fire the oxygen is explosive, which could potentially blow the doors that seal the decks, allowing the fire to spread. The third is in the wording of (Megan?); who says that it will seal off the affected <i>deck</i> which is SW generally refers to an entire level. While this may just be a wording error by Randall, given the humor of the rest of the system, it would not be a great leap to imagine a system that seals off a whole floor regardless of the size of the fire, killing everyone on that floor. In addition, given that the Empire is evil, it is also not a stretch to believe that they would kill an entire deck for a small fire just because the alternative is boring. This kind of scenario was in fact explored in the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Lost_Stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars: Lost Stars">Star Wars: Lost Stars</a> where it is described that entire decks were destroyed during the scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> where a star destroyer chases the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field. This destruction is pointed out in the novel and dismissed, as it is in this comic.

<td>The ant comic was released only a week after this comic and refers how cool ants are. Ants are also used twice in TE A zoom in on an ant is used to indicate size in <i>Earth's past</i> and under the <i>Tree</i> in that explanation there is an ant colony where one ant is much bigger than the others: an ant queen, a clear reference to the ant queen in the Destroyer. The other comic is a discussion running along exactly the same template ending in <i>Eww</i>.
<p>This is probably a reference to a part of Orson Scott Card's "Xenocide" in his Ender series. In it, the main character, Ender, visits a hive queen "bugger" he saved on his travels and became friends with, at a time after the queen has settled in on a new planet. At one point, Ender brings other humans to meet the queen at a time when she was giving birth to some of her drones. This is most likely meant to represent a parody of that conversation or else represent a comedic idea of his first conversation with her when she had been birthing, where Ender is alone and is speaking to the Hive Queen. In this version, when he finds out that she is in the process of birthing more ants, rather than being compassionate and understanding with the Queen (as he is in the book), Ender is weirded out like the other humans he brings along with him later.

<p>As previously noted, the comic bears considerable resemblance to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1110:_Click_and_Drag" title="1110: Click and Drag">1110: Click and Drag</a>. The comic is made in much the same way, with 'drawn' images "glued" together to form a large "map", with the illusion of infinite bounds made possible through space saving techniques where blank tiles are not stored and are instead painted white. The boundary between blank squares and 'drawn' squares is made clear as any white space in the normal images has a very slight grey tint. Thus, seams between images and blank spaces can be discerned.
</p><p>The tiles for the map are stored as simple PNG files in the naming scheme: X:-Y+s.png. An example from the starting tile can be seen here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png">http://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png</a>, with the coordinate (X, Y) coordinate (1000, 1074).
</p><p>Each file is 513x513 pixels in size, one pixel is reserved as overlap to ensure seamless joining of images. The image tiles names are listed as coordinates in an X - Y grid with X in the range from 928 to 1108 and Y in the range from 928 to 1112. 
</p><p>Internally in the game, the position of the player is given for instance as (X: 512187, -Y: -549668) for the starting position. Then these numbers are divided by 512 and rounded down. This gives the coordinate of the tile that the hoverboard is currently in.
</p>
<dl><dd>(X: 512187, -Y: -549668)/512 =&gt; (X, Y) = (1000.37, -[-1073,6]) =&gt; (1000, 1074) when the numbers are rounded down. </dd></dl>
<p>The bottom left corner of the first tile, would thus be (1000, 1073), and the top left corner (1000, 1074) =&gt; (512000, -549888).
</p><p>The collision map is encoded in the darkness of the black. Using an image manipulation program, one can easily find the secret pathways even in the zoomed-out maps provided below by enhancing the contrast of the dark areas.

<ul><li>Using the Play Area as an example some of the features mentioned in this section will be explained.
<ul><li>The images used below can be seen together <a href="/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard/Screen-shots#All_of_Play_Area" title="1608: Hoverboard/Screen-shots">here</a>.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>But even while staying within the Play Area, defined as the area where you will not be told to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/Return_to_the_play_area.PNG">Return to the Play Area</a>, you can see all or part of twenty images. 
<ul><li>You can move one image left and right of the starting point before reaching the walls, and one image up without getting too high. But from there you can see part of the images one step further left, right and up, and from the starting level you can see part of the black images below as well.</li>
<li>This makes it a five times four images rectangle.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>This first example shows a full-size image combined from these twenty images that make up the play area starting in the top left corner with image <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/998:-1076+s.png">(998, 1076)</a> and finishing down the right corner with image <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.com/1608/1002:-1073+s.png">(1002, 1073)</a>. 
<ul><li>Here are only the images themselves, nothing with the game parts, i.e. coins and hoverboard Cueball:
<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/eb/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Images_Only.png">Play Area Full Size Images Only</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>This next example shows both where the tiles are and what you see to begin with, i.e. the starting view when loading the comic to begin with. Still without any in game details.
<ul><li>Here the tiles are lines out with green and the view frame is in red. From this it can be seen that the view is somewhat larger than a single image.</li>
<li>More precisely the view is 1.43 times longer and 1.34 higher than a tile giving an area almost twice as big (1.93 times), but only going about one-third of a tile length in each direction:

<li>This third example shows the game version, with coins and hoverboard, but still the hole Play Area and hence also the read viewing square.
<ul><li>This is included to indicate which coins can be seen to begin with and also how the view is centered around Cueball and the hoverboard.</li>
<li>Cueballs center is also the center of the view. His center is defined as the line of his body in the X direction and just above his hands in the Y direction.</li>

<p>By observing page code while playing, the game grabs and displays images based on location, and subsequently clears all non-visible images. The game uses what seems to be a position syntax to retrieve the intended images live and returns an error if such an image does not exist, such as a blank area. This technically means things could be added to the world and updated live. If the player is moving sufficiently fast or if the internet connection is slow, this means that the player can get stuck in a black area that does not load in time.
</p><p>This also means that the game does not have coded top or bottom limits, so any attempt to find the <i>ceiling</i> of the game will be futile unless the game is tweaked. The game does however have side limits, and it is not possible to go down further than image with Y coordinate 1073 (and it goes down to 1069 in the full image), so there is a bottom limit in the game. If using a <a href="#Cheats_and_Exploits">cheat mode</a> this may be different.

<ul><li>On a slow connection, it's possible to move into an 'open' area and then the black image loads in and (probably permanently, without tricks) traps you immobile.</li>
<li>Sometimes the timing of the game is completely off. This can make the Cueball move extremely slowly. Or on the other extreme make him go faster so the images jump and makes the graphic look horrible.
<ul><li>This error was actually used to discover something about how you move when pressing the arrows - see under <a href="#Controls">Controls</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>If the focus switches from the game to the page, the Cueball can freeze in midair. The same thing can happen if the window border overlaps the play area.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Controls">Controls</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1608:_Hoverboard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29" title="Edit section: Controls">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The keyboard controls are as follows:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Go Left</b> - Left arrow key, a or h</li>
<li><b>Go Right</b> - Right arrow key, d or l</li>
<li><b>Go Up (jump or hover)</b> - Up arrow key, w, or k</li>
<li><b>Go Down (if gravity disabled)</b> - Down arrow key, s, or j</li></ul>
<p>This control scheme covers the three commonly used directional key sets: WASD a set of keys commonly used by modern games; HJKL a set of movement keys used by vi and applications which attempt to mimic vi key controls (vim); and the arrow keys, the most generic set of keys which is usually accepted by most applications which take movement as input, these were commonly used in older games.
</p><p>On devices which have a touch screen and tilt sensor (portable devices like mobile phones and tablets) the controls are as follows:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Go Left</b> - Roll the device anticlockwise</li>
<li><b>Go Right</b> - Roll the device clockwise</li>
<li><b>Go Up (jump or hover)</b> - Tap the screen</li></ul>
<p>After inspecting the source code, there appears to be no way to move down on a portable device, this is only relevant if gravity is disabled (see <a href="#Cheats_and_Exploits">Cheats and Exploits</a>).
</p>
<ul><li>If you keep down the left/right control you will keep moving along in that direction as long as no object blocks you.</li>
<li>A jump will only take you a certain height. 
<ul><li>Then you drop down. </li>
<li>The jump is fast to begin with, then gravity stops you and revert the direction.</li>
<li>When descending again you accelerate to begin with but quickly reach a terminal velocity.</li></ul></li>
<li>If you jump repeatedly while keeping a left/right control down you will jump in that direction.
<ul><li>But if you only jump one time, while keeping down the direction control, then you will stop moving forward after about 2.8s, from then on you will just keep falling straight down or stop where you reached if on the ground. </li>
<li>This makes quite a difference when you jump into an opening from a high structure. If the background is completely white, you cannot see that you do not continue to move forward and will thus not be aware that you are now falling straight down, instead of going left/right. </li>
<li>It can actually be quite difficult to notice as you will leave any structures that can indicate this issue very quickly.
<ul><li>Of course, if you notice that you land much too close to some high structure from where you base jumped, you will begin to understand. For instance, falling off the floating rock, and not moving away from under neath it during that long fall.</li>
<li>The timing was discovered because of one of the <a href="#Bugs_and_errors">bugs</a> in the program that sometimes makes Cueball move extremely slow, so one jump takes more than 3s. </li></ul></li>
<li>The solution: if you wish to keep moving to either side while descending, is that after the jump, you release and repress the left/right control. Then you will continue moving in that direction as long as you do not jump again. </li>
<li>As long as you continue to jump you will also keep moving laterally if you keep one of those buttons down. This is quite counter intuitive.
<ul><li>This also means that when you jump up over a long distance (or continue to jump hover over the landscape), you will not have this issue, since every jump reactivates the lateral movement.</li>
<li>But if you jump over a small obstacle and then just keep another arrow down, you will soon stop, which could fool you into believing that it was an obstacle on the ground that held you back.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Aside from the obvious ability to move out of bounds in the game, there are some more obscure hidden features which can't be enabled through normal gameplay, the ones found so far are as follows:
</p><p><b>Modes</b> are activated by opening the Javascript Console (F12 [Or Command-Alt-I in most browsers under Mac OS X] to open Developer Tools, then Console tab) and writing corresponding commands.<br />
<b>Click to expand:</b>
</p>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed leftAlign" style="width:100%">
<ul><li><b>Gandalf Mode:</b> <i>i.am.gandalf = true</i> - jumps and runs further. displays a white Gandalf hat that works well in places where the avatar can't be seen.</li>
<li><b>Speedhack:</b> <i>explorer.opts.speed= *Value*</i> - Speed hacking, with 1 = normal speed</li>
<li><b>Jump Hack:</b> <i> explorer.opts.jumpForce= -*Value*</i> - Jump hacking, with -10 = normal jump (positive values cause the hoverboard guy to move down when jumping)</li>
<li><b>Mewtwo mode:</b> <i>mewtwo = true</i> - disables gravity</li>
<li><b>Noclip mode:</b> <i>noclip = true</i> - player is able to move around the map without collision. Combine with Gandalf and Mewtwo modes for free easy map traversal.</li>
<li><b>Goggles mode:</b> <i>ze.goggles()</i> - displays a small window showing area around the player in a pixelated manner. The goggles indicate collision boundaries (where the player touches the world) in cyan lines. Black pixels that are passable (such as other characters or text) will be highlighted red (allowing secret passages to be discovered).</li>
<li><b>Position Tracking:</b> <i>explorer.pos</i> - Returns the player location to the console. Can be used to track position and test to ensure you are still moving. Must be re-entered to compare positioning.</li>
<li><b>Position Setting:</b> <i>explorer.pos.x = *Value* or explorer.pos.y = *Value*</i> - Can be used to manually set a position within the world. The start is at x: 512106, y: -549612. The left terrain bound is at x: 475210, y: -553711. The right terrain bound is at x: 567281, y: -549712. Mewtwo and Noclip modes are necessary for exploring in this way.</li>
<li> <b>All the above:</b> <i>explorer.opts</i> - Contains all the game's parameters. You can directly mess with <i>gravity</i>, collision (<i>disableCollision</i>), jump force (<i>jumpForce</i>) and speed (<i>maxSpeed</i>), among others. Run <i>Object.keys(explorer.opts)</i> to list all available parameters you can tweak.</li>
<li> <b>List all coins:</b> <i>explorer.objects</i> - Array containing the position of the 169 coins of the game.</li>
<li> <b>Disable tilt input:</b> <i>getEventListeners(window)['deviceorientation'][0].remove()</i> - on Macs with motion sensor, disables tilt input which causes problems controlling the avatar</li></ul>
<p><b>Getting All Coins: </b> To instantly get all coins, input the below into the console window. Does not use standard formatting of [i] to avoid conflicts with i.am.gandalf

</p><p>Haven't read all the comments above so maybe someone has written about it? 
If you click up it seems to count how many times. So it will just show white and then when you release again, it will take longer to hit the ground the longer you have pushed up. Tried with 100 clicks (9-10 seconds) and 200 clicks (20 seconds).
I got about 163 coins in about 15886 seconds. (4 hours and 24 minutes.) That was with breaks. It was written so shortly on the screen I did not manage to take it down for certain. But after that I read here about the 169 and found that there where at least three in the volcano I had not noticed at first. And it seems likely that there would be three more I have missed. But really fun to explore.

</p><p>Just added in the 'collision detection' section the text "On a slow connection, it's possible to move into an 'open' area and then the black image loads in and (probably permanently, without tricks) traps you immobile." To expand upon this, if this is a risk to anyone else (I'm reliant on mobile internet, being away from any comparable landline capability) then you need to look out for perfectly horizontal/vertical edges.  For example, hovering up the side of the Washington monument and encountering (typically above the 'bricks' line) a completely flat top. Drifting onto that soon gets you embedded in the remaining Monument, somewhere well below the eventual tip. Alternately, drifting sideways over the landscape and discovering a perfectly vertical cliff downwards (just past the bowling pins is a prime location) tempts you to drift down it and then suddenly the solid land 'happens' around you, forcing a page-refresh and restart (though doubtless there's also various console tricks that could be used).  The well, also 'opens out', but it's a lie.  I've ended up trapped 'in white' below the now closed black blocks that surround the well bottom (and not found any way back up).  But if there a 'texture' (like other cliffs) or 'slope' (like the real Monument edge) to the surface, you're probably Ok.  It's a genuine surface or wall that you can generally navigate around without fear of being misled.

<p>We definitely need a better presentation of interesting objects/locations and their coordinates. Now, we have quite comprehensive multi-level bullet list and a newly-started table. Neither is perfect. We need some form that will show clearly what is where and where it belongs.
</p><p>Issues to solve:
</p>
<ul><li> Many objects are large and a single coordinates pair simply don't describe them well. We need a clear presentation form that will allow putting both a single pair and several ones, e.g. top and bottom for thin vertical objects (e.g. poles, The Monument), four corners for objects occupying large swaths etc.</li>
<li> Grouping - we need to group objects that belong to an area, like all things within the Star Destroyer etc. Multilevel bullets are ok, but how to do that in a table?</li>
<li> Order - within groups and between them, we need some ordering that will organize the entries. For example left-to-right then top-to-bottom or something like that.</li>
<li> Coordinates system - the "native" game coordinates are large numbers, and negative values for the y coordinate to boot. Someone proposed setting a new origin and counting from there. I think it's a good idea, but will require a firm decision, rewrite of radar code and recalculating of all coordinates written down so far.</li></ul>
<p>Any ideas?

<dl><dd>If it weren't for so much effort put in already, I think that we <i>could</i> re-class features as follows:
<ul><li> All coin locations, and/or links to the locations they are associated with (e.g. "in original game area" and "carried by a quadcopter drone"), if that's not considered 'unfair' to those wanting to actually play the game (without the self-discipline not to browse the list&#160;;).</li>
<li> Locations of all characters, certainly all stick-figures, but maybe also 'wildlife' (or automata) of notable types.</li>
<li> All monologues/dialogues/labels (albeit that this is almost entirely a subset of the prior list).</li>
<li> Other notable landscape (or structural) features that are more than mere 'flavour' (e.g. the T-shaped mushrooms/whatevers to the east, but not random ground-boulders).</li>
<li> Notable move-through spots; inclusive of 'sink-into'able waters/magmas (waist-height, neck-height, fully-submerged?), even when not featuring further hidden routes, but excluding vegetation (ground-grasses/tree-trunks) that <i>mostly</i> are pass-throughable.</li></ul></dd>
<dd> Some of these are themselves useful references to other items (e.g. "inside front of Blockade Runner" or "beneath eastern stretch of magma") and so can probably be sub-grouped as all items in a given structure ("coins within the initial play area", "characters/speech within the Star Destroyer") and some things do occupy a swathe (the 'play area', the Monument, the ships, the kites, with their strings; the hail of (regular) torpedoes).

</p><p><br />
Here follows an extensive Latin discussion:
</p><p>The commentator attempts to explain the motto, "Cur ego committitur dictar latinae."
</p><p>There is repeated suggestion of 'now' or 'just now' somehow arising from the text. And the commentator makes a beginner's error by suggesting that iustus/justus could be used to mean just as in, just now. English has multiple uses of just - as an adverb speaking about time or exclusivity, and as an adjective talking about right and appropriate. For instance:
</p><p>Adverb time: "Well that just happened." synonyms: currently, now
Adverb exclusive: "Just do it." synonyms: only, merely
Adjective: "That was a just choice." synonyms: righteous, appropriate
</p><p>Iustus (also spelled justus) is a translation of the adjectival form of English just/righteous. So the exmaple the commentator gives:
'Cur ego iustus committitur loquitur.'
	Would mean:
'Why is the righteous I made to speak.'
	or, if the adjective is being used as a noun:
'Why am I the righteous/just is made to speak.'
</p><p>Also, committitur and loquitur in the example are both third person singular, so neither could properly connect to 'ego' (English 'I'). To make sense in the expected way, we would need to put loquo- into the first person singular form at least.
</p><p>So if the commentator wants to insert the idea of 'just now' or 'currently,' I suggest they use an adverb:
1 recens, 2 jam/iam, 3 nunc, 4 iamiamque/jamjamque
1 recently, 2 now (inprecise), 3 now (this time), 4 now (at once, already, hurry it up man).
</p><p>On the proper translation:
	Dictus is a noun meaning word or speech, from the verb 'dico.' If you wanted to specifically imply that you were using audible words (rather than writing), you'd use the 'loquo-' base instead of 'dic-.' So dictus and dico (from dic-) mean 'words' and 'I say.'
	Dicto is a rarer verb meaning I recite, I dictate, I repeat, or something similar. See:
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dicto#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dicto#Latin</a>
	The principal forms are dico, dictare, dictavi, dictatum. So we talking about a third declension verb, and the base is dicta-. Dictar would be the first person present passive imperfect. Typically that form would mean something like:
'I am being recited.'
But since a person (as a physical object) can't be spoken or recited, the meaning is probably:
'I am being caused/made/forced to recite.'
	The exact nature of 'caused/made/forced' is described by the word, 'committitur.' The committ- base means commit, begin, or make happen. Committitur is the 3rd person (he/she/it) present passive indicative from:
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/committitur">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/committitur</a>
	Meaning:
he/she/it is made/forced to. (Has become committed.)
	So:
'Cur ego committitur dictar latinae'
	means:
'Why am I being made/forced to recite/dictate in Latin.'
</p><p>Also, it should be noted that while the Greeks invented many of the types of punctuation we use today, Romans usually only used periods. (And often Romans would use no punctuation at all. Sometimes they even left out the spaces between words.) Point being, the question mark; like the comma, colon, and semicolon; wasn't commonly used until after the introduction of the printing press. So the quote probably shouldn't end with one.
</p><p>My Latin is rather rusty, so if you have any better suggestions, please send me an email:

Also since this comic is from November 2015, and podcasts have seen their rise in the last few years only, (also they may have existed before 2015) such a reference would definitely need to be sanity checked if it was available before release of the comic. If so it could be given as an example to the trope.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 08:11, 3 February 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

So... I encountered an issue with the comic. Scrolling up I see that others appear to have found this before, where sometimes parts won't load, but I've never seen it this drastically... I left the destroyer, continued jumping until I reached the right side (when Cueball went all the way to the right), and fell, hoping to get down to the stork nest. I fell a minute or more before realizing something was wrong, after continuing to jump up for a long period of time I realized I'd been trapped underneath the ground (which was a smooth surface above Cueball's head). Turning on mewtwo, gandalf and noclip modes allowed me to get back up to the top, but I wanted to see how far down the tiles stop loading- I found it's three seconds in gandalf mode to get from the part under the ground to the bottom part of the volcano lair.

<dl><dt>Washington Monument</dt></dl>
<p>The text for the Washington Monument indicates that the crack might refer to damage from the 2011 earthquake. Is it possible that it instead refers to the fact that the Monument has a clear color change about a quarter of the way up, due to a halt in construction and a change in the source of the marble?

Has anyone else documented that Command + alt + k makes you go up? You keep going until you hit the downward key (which pauses ascent) or you hit the upwards key.

<dl><dt>Giant octopus "not real" arm</dt></dl>
<p>May it be a reference to the 2002 book "L'Oeil de la Pieuvre" ("The Octopus' Eye") by French author Serge Brussolo&#160;?
There is a giant octopus in the book, whose arms would fit the definition perfectly.
It is a good read, if you are into rather dark science-fiction/fantasy novel series targeting young adults demographics, and therefore I wish not to spoil it.
Although there might not be English translations available, if you would like to know the details I can provide in English or in French.
There are other obvious and known sources justifying the "not real" arm's appareance in the comic, but in the off chance Randall Munroe read this book, or used the same inspiration as the book's author, I guess that asking ourselves about the possibility does no harm!
