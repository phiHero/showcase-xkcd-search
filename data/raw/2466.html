<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> has created a thought experiment and corresponding chart about school courses. The idea is, "the subject of the class appears in the classroom" and the chart compares how dangerous and how unusual that would be. 
</p><p>In the title text two points that are off the chart to the left and right are also mentioned. See details about all the subjects in the <a href="#Table_of_subjects">table</a> below.
</p><p>Note that Randall uses similar diagrams in each of <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">388: Fuck Grapefruit</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1242:_Scary_Names" title="1242: Scary Names">1242: Scary Names</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1501:_Mysteries" title="1501: Mysteries">1501: Mysteries</a>, which also contain different items. They  also have extra points mentioned in the title text. In the first two comics the points are also off the chart, whereas for the last the description of the point is too long to fit on the chart. Extra info outside the chart is also used in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1785:_Wifi" title="1785: Wifi">1785: Wifi</a>, but this is a line graph.

</td>
<td>Absent very strange and unprecedented circumstances, every classroom has an atmosphere <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, and this is very good, because humans cannot survive without one.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Ethics
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>Ethical thinking and behavior are widely considered good and should normally be present in education, but are sadly not universal.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Education
</th>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>10%
</td>
<td>Learning usually goes on in classrooms, so education as a concept is both being learned about and present in the form of learning itself.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Bibliography
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>7%
</td>
<td>Bibliography is the study of books, and books are normally present in classrooms, particularly bibliography classrooms.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Human Physiology
</th>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>20%
</td>
<td>This comic assumes that there are humans learning in the classroom, which was true at the time this comic was published, although in many places at the time the comic was published, many classrooms were closed due to COVID-19 restrictions.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Public Speaking
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>15%
</td>
<td>Some classes require students to present things in front of the class, which is likely a requirement in a public speaking class. Thus, public speaking itself would be present in the class.
<p>Some classes also have a teacher talking or presenting to the students from the front of the class, another form of public speaking.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Architecture
</th>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>30%
</td>
<td>All buildings can be considered architecture, and most classes take place in buildings. This comic also refers to a class<i>room</i>, which is a room, and therefore considered architecture.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Library Science
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>Library science is concerned with the organization of knowledge, and is useful for finding information. Many classes require <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://papersowl.com/pay-for-research-paper">research papers</a> that require the use of books and other sources of information to complete them.  This would be even more appropriate for a class actually taught in the school library.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Furniture Design
</th>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>Most rooms have furniture,<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> so this would probably be present in a classroom. May also be implying the classroom furniture has not been assembled yet, making it not as good and a lesson in furniture design.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Culinary Arts
</th>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>30%
</td>
<td>Most studies of culinary arts include the teacher and/or students preparing food using the tools and/or techniques that have been taught, so it would be fairly normal for food to be a result of classroom activities.  How <i>good</i> it is, however, can be a mixed bag, especially for student cooking attempts.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Ergonomics
</th>
<td>5%
</td>
<td>45%
</td>
<td>Ergonomic equipment and workspaces promote comfort and efficiency, while non-ergonomic ones may be unpleasant, unhealthy, or even immediately dangerous.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Botany
</th>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>The near-neutral position of Botany (aka Plant Biology) suggests that the most likely reason for plants to be present would be something like a potted plant, which is not uncommon, and usually not unpleasant, but not very noteworthy. There are other potential reasons for plants to be present, but those are generally less likely.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">20th Century Authors
</th>
<td>65%
</td>
<td>10%
</td>
<td>Literature classes would benefit greatly from an open discussion or interview with the author himself. Sadly such things are rare, but not unheard of, putting it slightly on the "weird" side of the spectrum. Well-known authors of the 20th century have an increased likelihood of being retired or dead by 2021, but there are more authors of the 20th century who are well-established enough to be studied.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Exobiology
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>Exobiology is the study of extraterrestrial life. This would mean that an alien life-form was in the classroom. This is extremely weird but very good for people to investigate and research the alien.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">21st Century Authors
</th>
<td>60%
</td>
<td>20%
</td>
<td>21st century authors have the advantage (over 19th and 20th century authors) of typically being alive and active at the time this comic was published. However, most authors who were primarily active in the 21st century are still developing their body of work, and/or still awaiting the judgment of history. The better availability of such authors, as compared to 20th century author probably explains the slightly lower "weirdness" score, while the limited body of truly prominent authors probably explains the lower "goodness" score.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">19th Century Authors
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>15%
</td>
<td>No author who was active in the 19th century was alive at the writing of this comic<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, hence, having one of them show up in class would be extremely weird. The opportunity to interact with such a person would be utterly unique, meaning that it scores pretty high on the "goodness" metric, though interestingly not as high as a 20th century author. Possibly, the potential 'badness' of having a zombie or other reanimated being show up in your class is weighed against the advantage of having a historical figure there in person.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Paleontology
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>Paleontology is the study of the history of life on Earth as based on fossils. In geology classes, it would be normal to have some fossils in the classroom. However, fossils are not usually found in other classrooms, and especially below the college level. Randall is also probably implying the weirdness of finding a live <i>Jurassic Park</i>-style dinosaur.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Robotics
</th>
<td>55%
</td>
<td>30%
</td>
<td>A course on robotics would often be expected to have some form of working models of the robots being discussed. However, for it to have "showed up" in your classroom could imply an actual functioning robot prototype walked into the classroom. While not cause for concern (as long as nobody in the class is named Sarah Connor), this would be a bit weird.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Martian Soil Chemistry
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>35%
</td>
<td>Martian soil only reaches Earth in small amounts, so it would be unusual to find a meaningful amount anywhere, except Mars.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Tourism
</th>
<td>75%
</td>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>Tourists coming into an active classroom would be quite unusual. It could refer to the students leaving to become tourists in another location.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Child Psychology
</th>
<td>60%
</td>
<td>45%
</td>
<td>Children are rarely students in classrooms advanced enough to teach child psychology. In order for child psychology to be on display, presumably someone would have to have brought a child (either for a demonstration, or for some other reason), which is slightly weird, but not unheard of.  This is considered slightly 'good', presumably because it would give students some opportunity for firsthand observation, and because most people like, or at least tolerate, children.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Entomology
</th>
<td>15%
</td>
<td>55%
</td>
<td>Entomology is the study of insects. Insects getting into a classroom is a very common event, even putting aside the possibility of someone bringing insects specifically to study.  Most insects that might get in are relatively benign, but some (such as mosquitoes) might sting or bite, and many people simply don't like insects, even when they're not harmful, pushing this slightly into 'bad' territory.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Occupational Therapy
</th>
<td>10%
</td>
<td>62%
</td>
<td>Injury, illness or mental health problem that hinder your participation in life/school.  Many students who have significant physical injuries and conditions that require occupational therapy would generally not engage in those activities during a class, although volunteers may be brought in as a demonstration of a particular health problem or method of treatment.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Hydraulic Engineering
</th>
<td>40%
</td>
<td>62%
</td>
<td>Likely in the form of flooding or plumbing problems.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Pest Control
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>70%
</td>
<td>This is not dissimilar to entomology, but pest control tends to involve larger infestations, as opposed to individual insects, and also includes non-insect animals, such as rats. Such events in classroom are not as common as individual insects getting in (especially in a well-maintained building), but are far from unheard of, and risk many negative effects, from bug bites to structural damage, and may require evacuation and fumigation to deal with.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Foodborne Illness
</th>
<td>15%
</td>
<td>80%
</td>
<td>Sometimes students in a culinary arts class do not properly observe hygiene standards and the food they present would lead to illness in those that consume the food.  Thankfully, this is rare if the teacher is paying enough attention to proceedings. Students could also be ill from food eaten outside of class.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Criminal Law
</th>
<td>45%
</td>
<td>85%
</td>
<td>This might happen if a crime occurs in the class. While an armed robbery is unlikely, incidents involving plagiarism or drug use are not particularly uncommon. Regardless, such an incident would be very bad, and a teacher may get in trouble for it.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Physiology of Stress
</th>
<td>0%
</td>
<td>90%
</td>
<td>Stress in a classroom, even stress that's bad enough to manifest itself in physical symptoms, is all too common.  Stress that bad is very harmful, and a student realizing that they were manifesting the symptoms they're studying should take it as a warning sign.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Oncology
</th>
<td>25%
</td>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>Oncology is the medical practice of treating cancer.  For someone in a classroom full of students to have cancer is, unfortunately, not an uncommon event, putting it on the 'normal' side of the scale.  While not abnormal, it's clearly very bad.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Ornithology
</th>
<td>60%
</td>
<td>55%
</td>
<td>Ornithology is the study of birds. A bird getting into a classroom would be somewhat strange, but there are circumstances under which it would happen. In most cases, that's not especially dangerous, but it would be disruptive, and introduce the possibility of the bird making a mess, and possibly getting hurt (or even hurting others), which makes it slightly bad.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Animation
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>56%
</td>
<td>Examples of animated works might be displayed to the students in an animation class. It would be weird for animated characters to appear physically in the classroom instead of being projected on screens. Possibly a reference to movies such as <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i> in which cartoon characters actively interact with the live action cast. As many of the characters abide by different physics, and a couple are depicted as insane, this would be very weird and potentially bad.
<p>Meeting actors costumed as an animated character to present or promote something would be generally better and somewhat less weird, but it arguably might not count as animation come to life.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Petroleum Geology
</th>
<td>65%
</td>
<td>60%
</td>
<td>Crude oil coming up through the floor of the classroom would be <i>very</i> weird. Any potential for hands-on learning experience would be limited, and quickly outweighed by classes being disrupted entirely (be it damage to the building, or oil companies trying to negotiate for the land).
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Highway Engineering
</th>
<td>75%
</td>
<td>65%
</td>
<td>A highway being built through an active classroom would be very unusual and not that safe.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Toxicology
</th>
<td>55%
</td>
<td>75%
</td>
<td>Most likely, a toxic substance is present in the room. This is not very weird if the room is in a building that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Asbestos">asbestos</a>-containing insulation (typically associated with buildings constructed before the 1990s, although it has not been specifically outlawed in the United States due to industrial lobbying) or lead paint (which was fully outlawed in 1978, so any paint must have been applied prior to that date). However, toxic substances are unsafe for humans<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Hematology
</th>
<td>75%
</td>
<td>70%
</td>
<td>Hematology is the study of blood. Given that there should be blood in each of the students present<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, we should probably assume Randall means "large quantities of blood outside of one's body", which would indeed be both bad and weird.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Hostage Negotiation
</th>
<td>70%
</td>
<td>85%
</td>
<td>Reasons as to why there would be hostage negotiations taking place at a school have horrifying implications for the students and teacher.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">History of Siege Warfare
</th>
<td>100%
</td>
<td>80%
</td>
<td>This would be an exceptionally strange event.  Given that the topic is 'history', having it show up implies that either historical figures have the classroom under siege (possibly through time travel or reanimation) or at least that the besiegers are using traditional weapons and methods in their attack.  In either case, it would be a very weird event, and also very bad.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Trauma Surgery
</th>

Not only would the power of a quasar destroy the classroom (as well as the rest of Earth,) quasars are too large to fit inside any known classroom. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULAS_J1342%2B0928" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ULAS J1342+0928">ULAS J1342+0928</a> has a mass of 8*10^8 solar masses.

While each classroom classroom contains a small portion of the Earth's surface (normally not enough of it to be interesting to geographers), having the <i>entire Earth</i> appear inside a classroom would likely demand explanation. In particular, if this is an ordinary classroom (i.e. located <i>on</i> the Earth), the planet's simultaneous appearance within its walls would both defy our current understanding of spacetime, and risk <a href="/wiki/index.php/1515:_Basketball_Earth" title="1515: Basketball Earth"> disastrous consequences at the hands of curious students.</a> This could also be implying the classroom is suddenly being located on top of a geographic border, which would be highly unlikely, especially if it happened without warning.

<dl><dd>I agree. This should be sooooo far below the bad axis (or Volcanoes) that it should only have been mentioned in the title text. Of course Quasars do not exist in this age... But if one suddenly began in your class room it would be the end of the local spiral arm of the galaxy, and would devour most of what was there forming a new black hole center of the galaxy (a double black hole center). It would of course end all of Earth history as well as the solar system and the local cluster of stars. So putting it right under volcanoes, which would only destroy the local city (it was not given it was a super volcano), compared to ending Earths existence is not really serious. And as explained in the explanation he has previously also mentioned off chart points in the title text, as he does also for less interesting subjects in this one as well. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 19:06, 24 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I thought that, but it appears that vulcanology/volcanology are both possibly equally valid (though the 'vulc' definitions point to 'volc' ones almost always in online dictionaries, with the reverse mostly only as 'alternative', and 'vulcanologist' seems less acknowledged than 'volcanologist' in related-words linking). In many ways, that annoys me, but that might be the classicist in me rather than the geographer/geologist who appreciates that "vulcanology" might be a rather more limited field that would require no more travel to extensively study than can be afforded by a handy Sicilian fishing boat or light aircraft. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.19" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.19">141.101.99.19</a> 14:48, 24 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Would an alternate Geography = weird be due to an invading nation-state? We already have volcanology and other similar "The earth came into the classroom" things in the graph. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:OhFFS" title="User:OhFFS">OhFFS</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:OhFFS&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:OhFFS (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:42, 24 May 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>That would be bad, but still less weird than the actual Earth. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.114.48" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.114.48">172.70.114.48</a> 18:09, 26 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>TL;DR: Too many "citation needed" tags! It's not funny if you use it too much.
</p><p>Several parts of this explanation seem to have been written in such a way as to include statements against which nobody in their right mind would argue and, in any other context at least, would not require any supporting citation, and are hence appropriate places for the humourous use of "citation needed" often seen on this site.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> I very much appreciate the hitherto typical Explain-XKCD-style sparse (about once per article) use of "citation needed" but I feel that it loses much of it's comedic effect when used frequently (six times in this article as I write!) in text that appears to be composed with the purpose of including the tag several times. I appreciate that some of us enjoy reading explanations peppered with the tags, so I haven't removed any of them, but my feeling is that the 'too much of a good thing' concept applies here. In future articles I personally hope to see normally written explanations (or as normally written as we can reasonably expect given the subject matter) with "citation needed" tags used only sparingly.
