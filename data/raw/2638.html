<p>This comic depicts an extension of the National Fire Protection Association's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:NFPA 704">NFPA 704 Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response</a> "fire diamond" emblematic insignia used to warn about the properties of hazardous substances inside a building, vehicle, room, cabinet, or container that are important during an emergency or accident, such as a fire, earthquake, spill or leak, bringing the diamond from 2x2 squares to 3x3 by adding five variously useful and humorous squares along the bottom edges.
</p><p>The numbers in a normal NFPA 704 diamond do not specify values of substances' properties, but rather broad categories designating characteristics of the substances of greatest interest to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responders" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:First responders">first responders</a> and hazardous materials cleanup crews. Randall's expanded diamond breaks with this convention, with several squares (Lilac, Orange, and Black) denoting absolute values, and one square (Green) denoting an economic value. This could very easily lead to documentation update headaches, especially since the Green square is mostly determined by supply and demand, and the Lilac square is linked to political outcomes. See explanation for each field in he extended square below in the <a href="#Table_of_extended_diamond">table</a>.
</p><p>The only easily identifiable substance which could likely meet the specific insignia numbers shown in the comic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thionyl_chloride" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Thionyl chloride">thionyl chloride</a> (SOCl<sub>2</sub>), a chlorinating reagent and solvent regulated as a chemical weapons precursor and sometimes used in the production of methamphetamine, which would also be represented with the <b><s>W</s></b> symbol inside the white square, indicating reactivity with water.
</p><p>The title text (which references "scary stories" of the Black square) refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylmercury" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dimethylmercury">dimethylmercury</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prions" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prions">prions</a>. Dimethylmercury, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Hg, is an organic form of mercury with an NFPA score of 4-4-3 (contact can be fatal, will burn below 73° F (22 °C), will combust if put under pressure). In 1997, an American chemist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Karen Wetterhahn">Karen Wetterhahn</a>, died 298 days after a few drops of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Hg on her latex gloves were absorbed into her hand through the gloves, causing fatal mercury poisoning. Despite her having followed all safety protocols of the time, it was not then understood that the chemical was so toxic, nor that latex was so permeable to it. Prions are misfolded proteins that are responsible for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_cow_disease" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mad cow disease">mad cow disease</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wasting_disease" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chronic wasting disease">chronic wasting disease</a> in non-human animals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a> in humans. These would indeed be the kind of substances that would scare those working with them in their labs; if an accident occurred, the results could be calamitous. See for example the case of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/second-lab-worker-with-deadly-prion-disease-prompts-research-pause-in-france/">Émilie Jaumain</a>, a lab technician who died after accidentally coming into contact with prions in mouse tissue.
</p><p>But a few labs have apparently had accidents involving a soda machine or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropped_ceiling" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dropped ceiling">dropped ceiling</a>. The latter may be a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_smallpox_outbreak_in_the_United_Kingdom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:1978 smallpox outbreak in the United Kingdom">the death of Janet Parker</a>: One inquiry found that she was infected with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Smallpox">smallpox</a> when a sample traveled upward from a lab on the floor below hers; however, other investigations have challenged that finding. There are occasional instances of vending machines causing injury or death, usually caused by people trying to shake or tilt the machines to get product out and having the machine tip and fall on them.  On average, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/1996/CPSC-Soda-Vending-Machine-Industry-Labeling-Campaign-Warns-Of-Deaths-And-Injuries">a couple of Americans per year</a> are killed in this way. Reagents obtained in this way tend to have more impurities than those usually used in labs, but are relatively safe to shake.

<td> Number of digits in the street value ($/gram) (2) </td>
<td> Describes the order of magnitude of the price (in USD) of one gram of the substance when sold illegally and informally. This is done on a logarithmic scale, with a '1' selling for $9/gram or less, a '2' selling for $10-$99/gram, and so on. As such this is the first of several squares where the number may presumably go to 5 or above (which is not allowed on the original Blue/Red/Yellow squares, as they do not denote strict numerical values). That said it's not immediately clear how substances which command &lt;$1/gram would be handled.
<p>Randall's example substance apparently sells for tens of dollars per gram (which would be similar to most common illicit drugs).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Center Right </td>
<td> Dark Purple </td>
<td> How much of a hassle it is to dispose of (4) </td>
<td> While many things can be thrown in the trash with no additional procedures, substances that merit an NFPA 704 square often require additional procedures to avoid significant danger, damage to the environment, or hefty dumping fines. Biohazards that may carry diseases are often disposed of in special containers, and nuclear materials are notoriously difficult to safely dispose of. This square would be at least theoretically useful, though not as much as the actual disposal guidelines.
<p>If the numbering here follows the scheme of the real categories, Randall's example substance is about as hard to dispose of as it gets. This matches the substance's rating of 4 for Blue and 2 for Yellow. Presumably it requires highly specialized handling or processing, and may also very bulky or awkward to store.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Bottom Left </td>
<td> Lilac </td>
<td> Number of federal agencies who want to know if you have any (3) </td>
<td> In many countries, including Randall's home country, the USA, the government has agencies dedicated to controlling or limiting the use of regulated substances, due to their use as drugs, weapons, harm to the environment, etc. While any given substance might be of interest to one agency, something that is both an environmental hazard and a chemical weapon component could interest, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:EPA">EPA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Safety_Board" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chemical Safety Board">Chemical Safety Board</a> and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Bottom Right </td>
<td> Orange </td>
<td> How many times you have to scrub your hands after touching it before they stop smelling weird (1) </td>
<td> While the real NFPA 704 chart describes properties ranging from unsafe to potentially deadly, this square describes a minor but very real inconvenience. Some things are harder to wash off your hands than others, and, given that most people don't often work with dangerous substances <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, this would be a more common, but less relevant, concern for many people.
<p>In this case, the substance, or its residue, seems to be fairly easy to wash off. This is seemingly incongruous with its ratings in the Blue and Black squares (see below), though it's possible that this substance simply doesn't have a strong odor.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Bottom </td>
<td> Black </td>
<td> Number of times it's caused one of those terrifying lab accidents that chemists tell scary stories about late at night (2) </td>
<td> This square might show how concerned and careful someone should be in handling the substance in question, especially if the number is more than one. However, it would be dependent not just on how inherently dangerous the substance is, but also on how commonly it occurs in labs. It's also vague as to what kind of accidents it has been involved in and what precautions therefore need to be taken. It could, for example, have caused some terrifying reaction, destroying things around it, or it could be very large and unwieldy and liable to crush people if handled improperly.
<p>In this case, it seems the substance has caused two such accidents, presumably on account of its high health risk of 4 in the Blue square, and may also be linked to its hazardous disposal score of 4 in the Purple square.

<dl><dd>There are very, very few Health 4 / Fire 0 / Instability 2 compounds. The NIH database lists 4: nitrous oxide, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorous trichloride, and thionyl chloride (although it's important to note these values aren't always standardized; some authorities consider phosphorus oxychloride to be Health 3, for example). Based on the street value and the number of US agencies who would be concerned about it, my guess is thionyl chloride, a useful industrial chemical which is also used in at least one meth lab synthesis pathway... AND highly regulated as a chemical weapon precursor (to both sulfur mustard and G-series nerve agents). Oh, and it is absolutely a Disposal Pain 4 candidate, too. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Qalyar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Qalyar (page does not exist)">Qalyar</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Qalyar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Qalyar (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:52, 28 June 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Not sure what source you consulted for this? Nitrous oxide is 2/0/0/OX and phosphorus oxychloride is 3/0/2/W.

<dd> It could be the drop ceiling - if it's even moderately unstable that would certainly make it a hazard; it would be a pain in the arse to dispose of; there are probably a few agencies with an interest building regs, etc. that would want to know about it. I'm not sure what kind of street price it would command, though. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.211" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.211">172.70.85.211</a> 16:20, 28 June 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It could be something that wouldn't normally be classified as a material, like a velociraptor. I'd think more government agencies would want to know about their existence in reality, but it's possible in this universe their existence is less atypical. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Edda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Edda (page does not exist)">Edda</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Edda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Edda (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:03 29 June 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd> As an English speaker myself (rightpondian), I had to say I never knew the term before this comic. To me, they always were "suspended ceilings" (as, apparently, pretty much all the patents for them are, when I checked). Or maybe "false ceiling" but that might include no-gap re-lining to make a plaster ceiling look like it's wood. But "drop ceiling" (reminiscent of the "drop bear"!) is yet another thing our leftpodian cousins surprise me with.&#160;;)</dd>
<dd> (Sometimes the gap itself is known to me as "crawlspace", though of course you rarely can physically crawl there, not being man-rated (nor ever having ventilation-ducts of convenient me-size, because we tend not to do that so much in the UK), and I've never felt I could escape (say) velociraptors by heading up there, but it's definitely where I "crawl" cables, every now and then, adding new network cables to any given office space, and I can tell you how dusty it gets up there. I've never thought it more than 'ambient' dust, as nice or nasty as that might be considered, but as I feed/thrown cables around from one edge of a room to another I find that it's best done at the end of a work day, and not just so I don't have to work around those who sit beneath...) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.90.173" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.90.173">172.70.90.173</a> 11:37, 29 June 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I was wondering whether the whole thing was inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Aqaba_toxic_gas_leak" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2022 Aqaba toxic gas leak">2022 Aqaba toxic gas leak</a>, that it was published well within a day of. Probably not (because 'too soon', especially with deciding what humour to add, assuming he started from scratch) but he might well have heard of it even as he was already mid-way through the drawing/publishing process and felt it ok to press ahead (perhaps modified to make it <i>less</i> likely to be directly associated in some way).</dd>

<p>"Weird lab where it's about the soda machine" example, from the Bourne Physics/Chemistry Building at Royal Holloway, University of London (but I'm struggling to find a source I can cite) had a story that was always told on "new student tours" / open days etc. There's a corridor there where an odd pattern of the floor tiles don't match, approx down the middle of most of one corridor, to the vending machine at the end of the hall, which also has 2 mismatched buttons. It's not 100% clear what the unlucky individual did to become highly radioactive, but he then allegedly decided he needed a drink. Later, the clean-up crew, after decontaminating the room where the accident occurred, could tell using a Geiger Counter exactly what route the guy took to the soda machine, including where he staggered - particular floor tiles were radioactive enough to remove and dispose of as "radioactive waste", replacing them with tiles that evidently didn't match the originals very well. Similarly, from the 2 mis-matched buttons on the machine, you can tell from what row/col the unfortunate victim ordered as his last drink. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.241.9" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.241.9">108.162.241.9</a> 02:58, 29 June 2022 (UTC)
</p><p>I don't want to get involved in someone's edit-war, but I think the reasonings behind <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=2638:_Extended_NFPA_Hazard_Diamond&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=288088">this edit</a> are easily refutable:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>all other squares have descriptions</i> - yes, but all other squares have arrows to indicate an externalised description, there's no reason to believe that this would not have an arrow pointed at it from outside <i>or</i> inside, at a push. It may even be self-descriptive, but there's no reason to believe it isn't fully diagetic</li>
<li> <i>parenthesis wouldn't be used for a symbol</i> - but a strikethrough would? Because it is...
<ul><li> If anything, less ludicrous (potentially a strike against my final theory, mentioned below, which I will admit for completeness)</li>
<li> You would have better mentioned that it's big and entire words, not a diagraph/monograph abbreviation, but you didn't (and I think it wouldn't work as "SH"/whatever anyway, at any level of joke).</li>
<li> Parentheses aren't used for any other non-diagetic label, though we could argue the toss about whether they are the <i>replacement</i> for the arrow (which I think could have been drawn just as easily) and I think this aspect is a stalemate in this particular argument, but it's one I did consider when thinking about the merits of the various edits.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>and "Special Hazard" is the square description synonym used in the non-Wikipedia reference link at the top of the table</i> - not "Special Notice"? (The link may have changed since I first followed it, with interest, as we don't have these diamonds over here, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazchem" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hazchem">Hazchem</a> boards... nothing like seeing a bit of 3YE flammable liquid on the move! ...but whereve I first checked it certainly wasn't "Special Hazard".)</li></ul>
<p>...I think it is intended as a rather clever self-referential joke. Why leave the square empty, except for the rather boring 'real' description? At least the other three standard sub-diamonds have some food for thought in their indicated values. Very unlike Randall to do <i>nothing</i> in that space when all kinds of real fun could have been had. I think I also believe (along with at least one other editor out there) that this is the particular fun that he decided to have with it. Much more believable than the alternative, IMO.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>If it wasn't for the parentheses I would agree with you.

From "Ha ha... No, never actually thought to do that" through to "*sigh* - I shouldn't need to explain the whole joke, folks! You take this far too seriously<i>[1]</i>, just enjoy the bits you understand...". If you go and pester Randall on Twitter/whatever and get his word that it's the former, then perhaps you can consign it to "confirmed not to be this", but then you'd be obliged to report the possibility in order to show the refutation itself, so probably counter-productive even if proven correct...&#160;;) Leaving it as "it possibly might be..."/whatever the best wording, however, does not make any insistance that it <i>is</i>, but certainly adds something to the kind of person like me who likes to see what others have gotten from the comic (however wrong). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.86.64" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.86.64">172.70.86.64</a> 16:06, 14 July 2022 (UTC)
