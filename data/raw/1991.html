<p>This comic is a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Scatter_plots" title="Category:Scatter plots">scatter plot</a> that ranks different research fields according to the precision of the knowledge of the number of the studied object (vertical axis) vs. how large (the size of) the studied object is on the horizontal axis. 
</p><p>For instance, the facts pertaining to the number of United States presidents are well known (although the exact number is disputed in that Grover Cleveland is usually counted twice, because he served non-consecutive terms, so the official count exceeds the number of unique Presidents), so the study of their history is at the top of the Y-axis. This study is placed close to the Y-axis as the size of a president is about midway in size between the two extremes of the X-axis, elementary particles to the left (small) and the entire cosmos (cosmology) to the right (big). 
</p><p>On the X-axis, Presidents are close to the middle. Both presidents and other larger life forms (as a research area) including extinct animals (paleontology) and exobiology are all close to the same central position just right of the Y-axis, with smaller animals like birds and insects just to the left of the Y-axis. But where the number of presidents is well known (aside from the dispute about Cleveland), then the number of exoplanet life forms (exobiology) is completely unknown (and would likely be affected by other disputes, such as whether something the size of Pluto counts as a planet) and thus it will be found at the very bottom of the Y-axis, since we have no idea if there are life elsewhere and if so how many places will it be and how varied.
</p><p>The 19 research areas are listed and explained in the <a href="#Tables_of_research_areas">tables</a> below.
</p><p>In the title text, mathematicians may give a third answer that the concept of counting the things being studied is not reasonable, because the things are abstract or otherwise not discrete.  There are many different types of math that blend into each other, and many have turned into separate sub-disciplines based on different interpretations of fundamental rules.  As a specific example in geometry, different interpretations of how many lines you may draw parallel to another line through a given point has lead to hyperbolic (infinite parallel lines) and spherical (0 parallel lines) geometric systems that are just as valid (and valuable, in some contexts) as the more commonly known Cartesian (1 parallel line) geometry.  As a specific example of the blending, number theory and set theory and topology all interrelate and it is difficult to concretely say whether many theorems belong to one branch of math or another.

<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle_physics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elementary particle physics">Elementary particle physics</a>
</td>
<td> The smallest subjects that we have actually detected are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elementary particles">elementary particles</a>. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Standard Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics, they are considered point masses (i.e. to have zero width). They may be made of smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:String theory">strings</a> but if so these have still not been detected.
</td>
<td> We think we have a fairly good estimate of how many elementary particles that are known. There could be some uncertainty though, so it is not at the very top.
</td>
<td>Elementary particle physics is concerned with the study of subatomic particles (the smallest things that we know of), of which there are 17, not including antimatter. Most notably, until recently it was uncertain whether the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Higgs boson">Higgs boson</a> was one of the elementary particles, but scientists have a "pretty good estimate" because the mathematical models don't predict the existence of many other particles

</td>
<td>Several mm to several centimeters
</td>
<td>Most teeth are visible to the naked eye, and dentists have x-ray technology to see what's not visible, so counting them is pretty straightforward.
</td>
<td>Dentistry is the study of teeth (pretty small, both in size as well as in quantity). Humans adults grow 32 teeth, which is a "pretty good estimate" since it is very rare for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdontia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hyperdontia">more than 32 teeth to grow</a> and it is rather common for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_teeth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wisdom teeth">wisdom teeth</a> to be surgically extracted or in some cases never to develop. Children may only have 20 teeth before they start falling out, but each tooth that falls out is because another tooth is growing underneath, so a child might have as many as 52 teeth, counting the child teeth that haven't fallen out yet plus the adult teeth that are starting to form.  So while a dentist will usually have a good idea how many teeth will be in a patient's mouth, they won't know for sure until they look or consult dental records.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> studies
</td>
<td>Most are the size of typical book.  In printed form, they would be in the range of tens of centimeters in height and width and ~1 centimeter in depth.  Although, if stored in digial form, they could be much smaller than a tooth, so it seems to refer to print or handwritten originals.
</td>
<td>Generally, 36 plays are attributed to him, but between 1 and 3 additional plays are considered "lost" (i.e. at some point between being first published or performed and scholars seriously studying Shakespeare, all known copies, references, and fragments were destroyed, making it impossible to determine whether Shakespeare actually wrote them or whether they actually existed as separate plays), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_apocrypha" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shakespeare apocrypha">some 20 more</a> are believed to have been written by him, but not signed. To make matters worse, some plays that <i>were</i> published or performed under Shakespeare's name are believed to have been written as collaborations (not fully by him) or mis-attributed (we don't know who wrote them but everyone says it was him).
</td>
<td>Shakespeare studies is concerned with the works of William Shakespeare.

<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ornithology">Ornithology</a>
</td>
<td>Birds tend to be small, with most species able to be held comfortably in hand; even the largest known flying bird, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Condor">Condor</a>, stands smaller than the average human, with a handful of non-flying avians such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ostrich">ostrich</a> being larger, but still weighing less than 2-3 humans.
</td>
<td>The number of known bird species is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird#Diversification_of_modern_birds">estimated at about 10,000</a>, though <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.amnh.org/about-the-museum/press-center/new-study-doubles-the-estimate-of-bird-species-in-the-world">a 2016 research result</a> suggested a near-doubling of this figure. As for the number of individual birds, a paper aptly titled <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018341530497">"How many birds are there?"</a> examines a number of ways of counting them; the results are "surprisingly consistent", with counts of approximately 200-400 billion individual birds.
</td>
<td>We do have a "pretty good estimate", to within perhaps a factor of two.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Literature">literature</a>
</td>
<td>As above, with Shakespeare plays, original or print reproductions would be the size of a book, typically.  Although ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolls" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Scrolls">scrolls</a> may have different dimensions with similar total volume.
</td>
<td>Because of the high number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_works" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lost works">lost works</a>, it is hard to have a solid estimate of the number, although rough lists have been made (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_literature#List_of_ancient_texts" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ancient literature">Ancient literature#List of ancient texts</a>).
</td>
<td>While it is fairly straightforward to look up how many books <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.proquest.com/products-services/Books-in-Print.html">are currently in print</a>, or how many books <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mashable.com/2010/08/05/number-of-books-in-the-world/">all currently printed information would fit into if bound into equal-length volumes</a>, and then limiting those estimates to those that date before a specific year, counting how many books from the period of interest haven't survived to the present day (books that were "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_work" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lost work">lost</a>" either by deliberate discontinuation, or accidental destruction such as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Library_of_Alexandria" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Destruction of the Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>) is a bit more difficult. However, because we know the work existed (it is mentioned by name in some other text), we have "pretty good estimate" that the number of lost works is "only" in the tens of thousands, as is the number of surviving works.

<td>About 125 non-extinct species.
</td>
<td>Marine mammals are the largest extant animals. The US Government <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/">recognizes</a> 119 marine mammals. However, what constitutes each species is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.marinemammalscience.org/species-information/list-marine-mammal-species-subspecies/">constantly being revised</a>, with new studies indicating either that what used to be considered a subspecies is actually a separate species, or that what used to be considered a separate species is actually a subspecies. As the depths of the ocean are further explored, species that were outright unknown are spotted and need to be classified. However, since marine mammals breathe air and thus must surface, it's likely that all species have been observed by scientists.

</td>
<td>As of 2021, 46 people (only 45 are unique; Grover Cleveland is counted twice because his terms were not consecutive) have served or are serving as President of the United States.
</td>
<td>Presidents are generally considered "big" men in history. Therefore, each one is fairly well known and documented. There is, however, some discussion on how many presidents there have been in the history of the United States, since prior to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">25th amendment</a>, it was unspecified whether vice presidents counted as presidents during the President's absence. Most notably, this ambiguity is the reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rice_Atchison" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:David Rice Atchison">David Rice Atchison</a>'s tombstone is inscribed with the words "President of the United States for one day" (he was not eligible and did not accept the duties even if he was).

</td>
<td>Railways can span across countries, and therefore are fairly large
</td>
<td>As railroads are built by humans, we know pretty well how many there are. However small systems(parks, mines) may make this number uncertain.
</td>
<td>A railway can span anywhere from a few hundred feet, to thousands of miles, so they're pretty big. The type of a railway is generally given by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Track gauge">track gauge</a>, which is defined as "standard" (the usual gauge for a region or country), "narrow" (rails closer together than that standard) and "broad" (rails farther apart than that standard). Since what is standard varies from country to country, and indeed from line to line, how many kinds of "narrow" gauge and "broad" gauge exist depend on who you ask. However, whereas every region has <i>a</i> standard gauge, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-gauge_railway" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Standard-gauge railway">standard-gauge railway</a>" has a specific meaning used by rail technicians and enthusiasts worldwide, of a track with rails 1435 mm (4 ft 8.5 in) apart. Anything narrower than that is often described as a narrow-gauge line, even if it is the standard gauge for a particular rail network.

There is no universally agreed upon number to how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rock_types" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of rock types">types of rock</a> there are, but all geologists agree they can be grouped into igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock.

<p>Dentistry is fairly straightforward, I think. Adults should have 32 teeth, children who have a full set but don't have wisdom teeth yet should have 28. Anyone missing teeth should have that information on their personal record. However, children occasionally lose teeth, and sometimes wisdom teeth need to be removed due to issues with them growing in wrong. It's also possible they could be lost in an accident, or for there to be a new patient with an unknown number of teeth. So a dentist can easily expect to know how many teeth should be in their patient's mouth, but may find they are off in some instances. Hence the mostly towards the top but not quite all the way of its placement. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:KingStarscream&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:KingStarscream (page does not exist)">KingStarscream</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:KingStarscream&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:KingStarscream (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:06, 9 May 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Children have 20 teeth, that will all fall out. But at some point they have all 20 and none other. So saying they have 28 makes no sense.  Some adults never get Wisdom teeth. Before the childbegins to loose they original teeth they may start to have some of the permanent though. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 21:16, 9 May 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>Standard gauge is pretty well established as being 1,435 mm. I realize it is tempting to say "standard" is whatever is common and in use in an industry/country, but even India refers to their network as "broad gauge" and the metro/tram lines as "standard gauge". Standard gauge is a commonly accepted technical term among railway engineers, and is used on over 50% of railways and is the primary gauge for North America, Europe, and China. Many countries are slowly converting their lines to standard gauge or only building new lines in standard gauge, such as Japan and Australia. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Cgrimes85" title="User:Cgrimes85">Cgrimes85</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cgrimes85&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cgrimes85 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:28, 10 May 2018 (UTC)

<p>'Microbiology studies microscopic (too small to see) organisms, of which some 1,400 are known and "estimates for the total number of microbial species vary wildly, from as low as 120,000 to tens of millions and higher", according to Nature magazine'  What is the 1,400?  The other numbers here look reasonable, but this one throws me for a loop.

The size is slightly larger than that of Presidents, and I don't know any women whose breasts are larger than a President.  Although the term is preceeded by the word "marine", so we're not talking about humans.  Maybe female blue whales have breasts that are larger than the size of an entire human.  (That could be of interest to the porn industry.)<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.59.4" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.59.4">162.158.59.4</a> 00:56, 24 December 2018 (UTC)
</p><p>The explanation about railway engineering is incorrect. Whereas every railway has <i>a</i> standard gauge, "standard-gauge rail" has a specific meaning of a track with rails 1435mm (4 ft 8.5 in) apart. Anything narrower than that is described as a narrow-gauge line by rail technicians and enthusiasts, even if it is the standard gauge for a particular rail network. Where I live in New Zealand, for example, the country's standard gauge of 3 ft 6 in means that the country's rail network uses a narrow-gauge track. I've amended the text accordingly. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Grutness" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Grutness" title="User talk:Grutness">talk</a>) 02:58, 18 May 2018 (UTC)
