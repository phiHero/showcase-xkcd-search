<p>People often find answers to computer problems by searching on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google">Google</a>, which attempts to guess your intended search term based on your location, language and the characters you've already typed, placing its suggestions in a drop-down box beneath the input area. If the search box is clicked on but nothing is typed, the drop-down box by default shows a list of your most recent searches.
</p><p>Here we see a list of search queries, each of which suggests the author is perversely misusing or overextending some computer technology. The overall impression is of someone technically sophisticated enough to shoot themselves in the foot, and who does not learn any larger lessons despite doing so repeatedly. The title text is another possible entry in this list.
</p><p>The caption implies that from Randall's perspective, every computer he uses seems to be broken; he doesn't seem to realise this is because he's the one using them, not because the computers actually start off broken. (For similar themes see also these comics: <a href="/wiki/index.php/349:_Success" title="349: Success">349: Success</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1084:_Server_Problem" title="1084: Server Problem">1084: Server Problem</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1316:_Inexplicable" title="1316: Inexplicable">1316: Inexplicable</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1586:_Keyboard_Problems" title="1586: Keyboard Problems">1586: Keyboard Problems</a>).

<dl><dt> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+translate+syntax+highlighting">Google translate syntax highlighting</a></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Syntax highlighting">Syntax highlighting</a> can be used when editing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Source code">source code</a> to make the code more readable and easier to understand. It is not generally used for natural languages, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_diagram" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sentence diagram">sentence diagrams</a> of brief passages are used in language education.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google Translate">Google Translate</a> is used to translate text from one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Natural language">natural language</a> to another. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:JavaScript">JavaScript</a> <tt>mouseover()</tt> to highlight words as an aid in matching phrases in the source with their translations, but does not apply different highlighting dependent on syntax.</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, this could imply that Randall is attempting to translate code from one programming language to another using Google Translate. Success would be unlikely, since the service is not intended for this <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, and syntactically valid output might further break the computer executing it.</dd>
<dd>Two other possible interpretations of this phrase are that Randall wants to translate the phrase "syntax highlighting" to another language, or that he wants to perform syntax highlighting on the source code for Google Translate.</dd>
<dt> Autodetect mixed bash zsh</dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bash (Unix shell)">Bash</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Z shell">Zsh</a> are two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Command-line interface">command line interfaces</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Unix-like">Unix-like</a> OSes. The way to execute commands is almost identical, making detecting a script that contains a mixed syntax nearly impossible. This was later referenced in <a href="/wiki/index.php/2510:_Modern_Tools" title="2510: Modern Tools">2510: Modern Tools</a>.</dd>
<dt> CPU temperature sensor limits</dt>
<dd> The CPU's temperature sensors exist to tell you when your CPU is becoming dangerously overheated (normally because of a faulty fan or overclocking). Someone who searches for information about the limits of those sensors is presumably expecting to misuse their CPU.  Probably also a reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1172:_Workflow" title="1172: Workflow">1172: Workflow</a>.</dd>
<dt> GIF to XLS</dt>
<dd> .GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) is a file extension used to store images and sequences of images to be displayed as an animation. .XLS is the file extension for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The joke is that the two file types are used for different purposes - it's quite normal for someone to want to convert between .GIF, .JPG, .PNG, .BMP files, as these are all image files; or between .XLS, .CSV, and .ODS files, as these all record tabulated information. However, for some reason Randall wants to convert an image file to a spreadsheet. (This is actually possible, because a digital image is essentially an array of colour and brightness values; it just wouldn't be particularly useful for most people. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet">Here</a> is a webpage with an online converter.) Matt Parker has done a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I">stand up routine</a> about converting these two file types.</dd>
<dd>An alternate way to convert an image file, such as a .GIF file, into a text-based file like an .XLS file, is through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Optical character recognition">optical character recognition</a> (OCR). This is only effective if the image is a copy (i.e. a scan or reasonably clear photograph) of a document containing letters and words, and neither .GIF nor .XLS are file formats anyone would usually use in that case.</dd>
<dt> Clock speed jumper sample rate</dt>
<dd> A jumper is an intentional short circuit used for selecting options for an electronic circuit. They are usually used where it is not feasible to use programming (such as outputting a byte or word through a port) to alter the selection, such as before the processor even begins executing. A common example would be, on some motherboards, jumpers can be used to alter the clock speeds of various motherboard functions (such as the CPU or the front side bus). These jumpers should ordinarily be modified when the computer is off. However, this search is asking how often the motherboard checks the status of the clock speed jumpers, implying that they intend to change these jumpers while the computer is powered on, and often enough that the sample rate matters (change cpu speed several times a second, by moving jumpers on the motherboard.). That is, of course, a little silly.</dd>
<dt> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+reinstall+keybinding">Clean reinstall keybinding</a></dt>
<dd> This refers to keybinding, the practice of mapping (binding) a certain key to a certain function (e.g., pressing PRTSC will take a screenshot). Most keyboards do not output characters directly, but only codes for which keys have been pressed (or released).  Keybindings translate the pressing of the "A" key on your keyboard into the letter "A" being sent to a program which is reading keyboard input. A "clean reinstall" of keybindings is something that would almost never be necessary - it means Randall has modified his default keybindings to such an extent that his <a href="/wiki/index.php/1031:_s/keyboard/leopard/" title="1031: s/keyboard/leopard/">leopard</a> has become unusable (similar to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1284:_Improved_Keyboard" title="1284: Improved Keyboard">1284: Improved Keyboard</a>), necessitating a "clean reinstall" of the bindings. Alternatively, he might be doing clean reinstalls so often that he wants a keybinding to execute them with minimal loss of time.</dd>
<dt> Cron job to update crontab</dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cron">Cron</a> is a utility on most Unix-like OSes that allows you to schedule commands or scripts to be run periodically. These scheduled jobs are read from a <i>crontab</i> file. A job that updates the crontab (therefore creating new jobs, removing old ones or editing existing ones) is paramount to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Job scheduler">job scheduler</a>, and trying to use cron for such functionality could result in highly unstable functionality (although a crontab could be sensibly regenerated periodically by a set of machines from a master crontab file annotated with per-host directives). This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Self-modifying code">self-modifying code</a>.</dd>
<dt> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fsck+chrome+extension">fsck Chrome extension</a></dt>
<dd> This is a search for an interface to the Unix <b>f</b>ile<b>s</b>ystem che<b>ck</b>er <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fsck">fsck</a> via third-party software added to Chrome. fsck is a program for checking your filesystem for corruption. Repairing a filesystem this way would be inadvisable. <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> This might indicate confusion about the meaning of the term "online filesystem repair", in which "online" means "while the filesystem is in use" rather than "over the Internet". Alternatively, Randall might want to repair an installation of the operating system Chromium, in a manner less drastic than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_reset" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Factory reset">factory reset</a> preferred by Google.</dd>
<dt> Recursive font</dt>
<dd> An idiosyncratic mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Recursion">recursion</a> and the font style <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cursive">cursive</a></i>, referring especially to text handwritten in a flowing manner. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:PostScript">PostScript</a> (the language in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_fonts" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:PostScript fonts">some fonts</a> are written) is capable of recursion and PostScript Type 3 fonts are able to use the full language. This could create effects like fonts with complicated fractal borders and fill patterns - but the increase in processing time would contribute to seeming brokenness of the computer (or printer) rendering the font.</dd>
<dd>A true recursive font would be a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fractal">fractals</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.matthen.com/post/5340546486/first-sketches-in-mathematica-for-a-new-font-it">example</a>).</dd>
<dt> Regex matching valid EBNF</dt>
<dd> EBNF refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Extended Backus–Naur Form">Extended Backus–Naur Form</a>, which is used to define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Formal language">formal languages</a>. EBNF specifies recursive patterns that are impossible for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Expression" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Regular Expression">regular expression</a> (regex) to determine whether it is valid or not. There is some irony in using regex to test the validity of something which <i>defines</i> the validity of things like regex.</dd>
<dt> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Hardlinks+Turing+complete">Hardlinks Turing complete</a></dt>
<dd> In some file systems, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ext4">ext4</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:NTFS">NTFS</a>, a single file may be referenced in multiple places in the file system. These filenames are termed "hard links" because the operating system automatically resolves them to the actual file. "Soft" or "symbolic" links are resolved indirectly via a pathname, which may reside anywhere.  A file is considered deleted when the last hard link to it is unlinked; a soft link exists independently of its target.  In fact, the target need not exist, in which case this is often called a dangling symbolic link.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Turing completeness">Turing completeness</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computational complexity">computational complexity</a> required to simulate any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computable function">computable function</a> (given an infinite amount of memory). Recently there have been cases where <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html">unexpected mechanisms</a> from card games to text parsers were proved to be Turing complete. Hardlinks being Turing complete would imply that creating and deleting hardlinks alone is enough to satisfy the requirements of Turing completeness.</dd>
<dt> Opposite of safe mode</dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_mode" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Safe mode">Safe mode</a> is a diagnostic mode in many operating systems and applications which allows the user to troubleshoot problems by disabling unnecessary functionality. The "opposite of safe mode" implies a "dangerous mode" where the purpose is to allow uselessly dangerous actions (in actuality this supposed dangerous mode is the default mode). A common example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sudo">sudo</a> command in Unix-like OSes, which grants the user system-level permissions.</dd>
<dd>It's also possible that Randall sees Safe Mode so often that he sees regular mode as an unusual and unique state and needs help navigating back to it.</dd>
<dt> Predictive touchpad</dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_text" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Predictive text">Predictive text</a> is a feature of many smartphone keyboards that predicts the most likely word the user wishes to type, and then gives the user the option to place the full word in the sentence immediately without having to finish typing it. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Touchpad">touchpad</a> is a computer pointing device, similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computer mouse">computer mouse</a>. The idea of a "predictive touchpad" seems absurd because, as opposed to typed words, there are not a limited number of swipe combinations that are possible on a touchpad. A "predictive touchpad" implies that a computer could predict where the user was going to move the mouse or click, which in this case would seem to defeat the purpose of a user input device. <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>.</dd>
<dd>Interestingly, a version of Linux had a predictive cursor option, where the cursor jumped to the nearest button (like window close) when it moved near to but didn't quite reach that button.</dd>
<dt> Google docs from bootloader</dt>
<dd> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bootloader">bootloader</a> is a very small program that is usually the very first thing to execute when a computer boots up. It is used mainly for loading the operating system into memory.

<dt> Hardware acceleration red channel only</dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hardware acceleration">Hardware acceleration</a> means that certain calculations are not performed by the computer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:CPU">CPU</a> but by a "specialized" processor, e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:GPU">GPU</a> which is part of the graphics adapter. This speeds up output, especially if complex 3D calculations are required, and reduces CPU load. To use this function only on a single color channel seems pretty useless, but one may want to troubleshoot a program that displays only red when hardware acceleration is enabled.</dd>
<dd>While graphics cards are most commonly used with three or four channels (red, green, blue, and sometimes alpha), they do support two-channel or single-channel images. An 8-bit single-channel image would use the format '<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Image_Load_Store#Format_qualifiers">R8</a>', which is indeed 'red channel only'. This type of image could be used to store monochrome images or non-image data.</dd>
<dt> autoexec code posted by verified twitter users. (<b>Title text</b>)</dt>
<dd> The term "autoexec" refers to code that runs automatically, usually during boot, and derives from one of three boot-time files for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>: AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS and COMMAND.COM.  AUTOEXEC.BAT would typically contain commands for customizing the command prompt, loading additional drivers, and/or automatically launching a program.</dd>
<dd>Automatically executing code from the Internet is generally a terrible idea, because it could be written by someone with malicious intent and harm your computer. The joke here is that the code would only be executed if written by someone who has been "verified" on Twitter. Twitter's verification service only serves to show that a user is who they claim to be, not whether or not their code can be trusted, so this would provide little protection. Usually, Twitter verification is used by celebrities so they can be distinguished from people claiming to be them. The line implies that Randall is only interested in running code posted by celebrities.</dd>
<dd>Most code downloaded from authentic sources (such as Microsoft and official Linux distributions) is verified by a cryptographic signature from a true trusted source, authenticating the origin of the software. These may include software updates that run automatically in the background.  The joke here is that the term "verified" means very different things between Twitter users and software distribution.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> It appears that explainxkcd.com is using Cloudflare, so all the wiki edits are probably logged as coming from Cloudflare's proxies.

<dl><dd>Sort of. In computing, it's a little more specific, though, referring to functions that call themselves as part of their normal running. This in turn has led to the idea of recursive definitions, that of course refer to the original word. Example: "recursion: see recursion."</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I take issue with the explanation for another reason, though. True, regexes probably can't be used to check the validity of EBNFs. It's a little bit more complicated than that, though. If one has ever used a compiler-compiler like yacc (which, supposedly uses EBNF grammars or EBNF-like grammars), another tool in the Unix world comes to mind, awk. Awk is similar enough in design to a cc that it can do the job of one, and people have apparently made compilers in awk. And what does awk use for its pattern matching? Regexes.

<p>Can some wonderful person provide an explanation for this? "This is probably a search for an interface to the Unix filesystem checker fsck via third-party software added to Chrome.

<dl><dd> I added the line "fsck is a program for checking your filesystem for corruption." based on the discussion immediately above, but an explanation for why a Chrome extension to execute this program is funny/weird would be helpful to people like me.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>As long as you are not trying to run the fsck on ROOT filesystem (or /home, or anything other currently mounted), it doesn't matter if it's chrome extension. But it's true that usually fsck is run as part of system boot, when no filesystem is mounted in read/write mode, and it is not possible to run Chrome in such situation. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 03:57, 16 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> [Extended explanation] Information about files often occur in multiple places on the disk. This redundancy increase the chance of repairing a corrupt file system. Fsck will read data from the disk, and if it finds inconsistencies, write new corrected data back. When a file system is mounted, a file system driver will read and write data of the disk in normal operation. If the two processes are simultaneous and unaware of each other, they may be confused and even create inconsistencies that wasn't there to begin with. E.g. original research: A file system driver may have cached data in working memory. If fsck updates that data on disk, the cache will be out of sync. The file system driver may be confused by this, or, if it writes back the cache to the disk, the fsck fix will be undone, and possibly a new different inconsistency would be created. Or, while fsck is comparing different parts of the file system, it will read one block at one point in time and another block at another point in time. At a time in between, normal operation may have created, changed or removed a file. Fsck then may think it has found an inconsistency (that does not exists) and try to fix it, possibly creating an inconsistency. Therefor, the fsck command will detect if a file system is mounted and issue a really scary warning against proceeding. /David A <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.80.33" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.80.33">141.101.80.33</a> 21:22, 24 September 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Is it really suitable to use the word leopard instead of keyboard? Even though it's linked to the relevant comic explanation it seems likely to add unnecessary confusion and doesn't really add to this explanation. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.34.217" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.34.217">162.158.34.217</a> 10:30, 10 May 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> It seems cool to me as long as the explanation is clear enough that your brain expects "keyboard" even if you previously didn't know what "keybinding" meant. I added a sentence to try and make it more obvious. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.158" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.158">108.162.250.158</a> 00:08, 11 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Isn't the clean reinstall keybinding pointless for saving time since he'd have to redo it every time he did a clean reinstall? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Figvh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Figvh (page does not exist)">Figvh</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Figvh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Figvh (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:34, 10 May 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> I think you're assuming that keybinding is about setting up new shortcuts (which the explanation used to seem to be saying); I think the jokes actually about the keyboard being functional at all... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.158" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.158">108.162.250.158</a> 00:08, 11 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Idea for Turing-complete hardlinks: get an old UNIX that allows hardlinks to directories. With those, you can create loops in the filesystem (it's now an arbitrary directed graph, not a tree). Write an interpreter repeatedly calls link, chdir, mkdir, or rmdir based on some pattern matching on the existing names. It could terminate when it finds itself in an empty directory. Now you write programs on top of that interpreter by carefully setting up a tangle of directories and launching the interpreter at the right starting point. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.60.53" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.60.53">162.158.60.53</a> 00:13, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

<p>maybe it's just me, but does google actually do this any more? it certainly used to. now all i get is nothing until i start typing, when i get a list of the most popular results for other people's searches. if you have to turn javascript (or something else) off to see this, maybe it should be mentioned. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.84" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.84">141.101.98.84</a> 12:36, 10 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>still having problems with this. i think i understand the joke, but the comic seems to rely on something which i'm pretty sure doesn't happen. i'm old enough to remember when google would allow the default browser behaviour for textboxes, which is to cache the values you entered in this box and display them to you as a dropdown when you started typing. pressing alt-down would open the list unfiltered and unsorted. this is, i'm guessing, what randall is alluding to. which means that the list is hist search history in google. which makes the text of the joke funny. unfortunately google doesn't do this any more. i've tried it in chrome, firefox, ie and edge and it just doesn't, even if i'm logged in as me. alt-down has no effect. if you start typing it does open a dropdown to autocomplete, but from very scant research this isn't in any way tailored to the user. it just gives you the most popular searches that complete the text you type, with no regard for your search history. i could be wrong about that. if i am, and google does tailor it to your particular search history, then that does make the joke funny again. since not only does randall search for these things enough that google noticed that he likes them (possibly because this is all he searches for) but people search for these ridiculous things enough that google thinks that they are popular. which, even if true is a little remote a possibility. and undermines the joke about randall being special in breaking his computer. maybe i'm overthinking it. or not. did i miss something obvious? this is supposed to explain the comics and i need a little help. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.84" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.84">141.101.98.84</a> 12:57, 13 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I might be wrong, but I think the explanation for "Google docs from bootloader" is missing the point entirely - I believe this is not referring to the application from Google but instead means having the bootloader access Google document files (note that "docs" is lower case here) in order to somehow control or modify the bootloader behavior.  These document files might be created and maintained through Google Docs (the application) and then accessed from within the bootloader later.  While this may be technically infeasible and extremely unwise for a variety of reasons, if it could be done, it would fit the subject of this comic perfectly - the result would be the potential for severe bootup problems!  --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User:Ianrbibtitlht">Ianrbibtitlht</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User talk:Ianrbibtitlht">talk</a>) 17:02, 4 June 2017 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> I see now that the text within the comic is all upper case, but the thought is still valid. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User:Ianrbibtitlht">Ianrbibtitlht</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User talk:Ianrbibtitlht">talk</a>) 17:08, 4 June 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
