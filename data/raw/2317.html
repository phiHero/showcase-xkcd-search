<p>Electronics connectors are designed to transport both information and power. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinout" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pinout">pinout</a> diagram describes the function of each pin such as to communicate data, transport power, physical function (keying), etc. In this comic there is an absurd alternative to the actual pins used in connectors. The pin labels are references to many tech issues and attributes, and not all may be documented correctly here.
</p><p>Hardware hobbyists might feel excitement at seeing a unified specification for these common connectors, but the comic is of course humorous.

</td>
<td> This is a reference to heavy-duty home and commercial appliances, which use 240V AC for power. Additionally, many cable specifications try to provide a way to power devices over them (PS/2, USB, Power over Ethernet,) but these small communication cables usually carry only DC and not AC electricity.
<p>High voltage power is only sometimes used in small communications connectors. It might help to keep the current of power lines low to avoid generating excess heat. With +240V DC inside the HDMI cable, monitors would not need any longer a separate power plug. This is similar to Power-over-Ethernet, which does not exceed 60V, or ISDN, which goes up to 110V depending on country, and helps surveillance cameras or telephones to work with one connecting cable only. But with this much voltage on such a small cable, a short could lead more likely to melting the insulation and wiring in a sudden burst of toxic smoke. The produced thermal power through a short with resistance R_short that is building up is U²/R_short, increasing with the square of the voltage (also the breakdown voltage of the isolation is more easily reached). However, a high voltage reduces the chance of a peripheral drawing too much current, which could cause a fire on thin wires otherwise: The current through the cable for a device, needing a given power of P, is I = P_dev/U, the thermal power of the cables with resistance R is P_cables = R_cables*I² = R_cables*P_dev²/U², so it is reduced by the square of the voltage.

AC is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Electric power transmission">electrical transmission</a> because it can be stepped up to high voltage to minimize transmission losses, then stepped down to more useful voltages right before loads. DC power is required for logic circuitry like in computers. Conversion between the the two kinds of power everywhere would make for transformers being embedded in most modern devices, taking extra materials to manufacture and losing a significant percentage of all electricity in the conversion. Having both is not entirely unheard of: the Commodore 64 power supply provides both DC, for the logic of the motherboard; and AC, for powering the tape drive.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:HDMI">HDMI</a> interface uses four pairs of shielded twisted-pair connectors, along with seven other connectors. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Twisted pair">Twisted pair</a> means a wire is wrapped with the other wire that returns the current to the original device, thus minimizing electromagnetic noise. Shielding refers to wrapping a cable with a conductor to absorb the energy of noise.) Three of these pairs are for data (TMDS Data0, Data1, and Data2) and the other is a clock. These pairs take up three pins as one of them is a ground pin for the shielding wrapped around each pair. TMDS stands for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition-minimized_differential_signaling" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Transition-minimized differential signaling">Transition-minimized differential signaling</a>" and is also used in the DVI standard.

</p><p>CEC stands for "Consumer Electronics Control" and is supposed to allow a single remote control to control multiple devices.

<p>A ground pin is commonly found on USB and other pin connectors. At least one ground is necessary to complete the circuit, and some cables use multiple ground lines to distribute current or to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Twisted pair">twisted pairs</a>. However, there is no purpose served by having many more ground pins than data pins. Therefore, it seems rather silly for the micro USB to have 4 ground pins and only 1 functional "USB" pin. It also does not give much information about what the "USB" pin would do, as opposed to a standard pinout diagram. This diagram also leaves out the +5V power pin that is present in the real micro USB connector, which would render most USB peripherals unable to function.
</p><p>The ordering and count of the pins may be an allusion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Monty Python">Monty Python</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spam (Monty Python)">"Spam"</a> sketch, in which one of the many Spam-related menu items is "Spam, Spam, Spam, egg, and Spam".

But this high a voltage might be an allusion to the high voltages USB-C screens and similar devices can request in order to get enough energy without exceeding the cable's current limit.

<td> Boobytrap Pin (Pure solder)
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Solder">Solder</a> is a metal alloy with a low melting temperature (typically around 360°C, but in special cases melting points between 90°C and 450°C or above are available), used to bond electronic components together permanently. Most solder materials are quite ductile so it might be too easy for the forces a connector is subject to to permanently change their shape. Along with the fact that the resistance of solder is typically way higher than that for copper the pin under heavy electrical stress could overheat and melt, thus bonding the connector to its receptacle, and thereby "trapping" the receptacle. Additionally putting a pin that might slightly change their shape directly next to a high voltage pin means risking accidentally connecting two power rails with entirely different voltages together (causing an overvoltage in the lower-voltage rail that is likely to break the circuit, as has happened with some Apple devices). In this case the +120V AC pin might be able to deliver enough power to actually fuse the solder-only pin. This could also be a reference to increasing publicity around the fields of electronics security: hobby reverse engineers have been finding ways for some time now to evade the blown fuses in microcircuitry preventing them from being reprogrammed, using glitching techniques.
<p>Another issue is that the heat required for anyone to solder a wire to the cable-side of that pin would cause the entire pin to melt and coagulate, triggering the boobytrap, and causing the pin to disappear and possibly make a mess next to the other pins.

<td> All connectors include portions whose job is to ensure a solid connection between the cable and the port. This is typically not the job of the pins, however. In real USB type C connectors, this task is performed by the center tongue of the female connector. It could also imply transmission of energy or signal through a mechanical principle, such as torque or reciprocating motion.

<p>The two sides of a USB C connector are labeled "A" and "B". These are rotationally symmetric, mostly. For example, B10 and B11 are Rx1, a separate twisted-pair for receiving information in Superspeed mode compared to A10 and A11's Rx2. This gives two Rx/Tx pairs for Superspeed use. CC1 and SBU1 are mirrored to CC2 and SBU2. However, the D, VBUS, and GND pins are perfectly mirrored.
</p><p>The fact that only half of the USB-C pins are documented might hint to an alternative way to manufacture connectors that can be inserted rotated by 180°: Make the receiver use only the right side of the pins and make the sender connect both the left and the right side so all Pins that might match a function are connected correctly no matter if the cable is rotated by 180°. However, doing this would result in only having one Rx/Tx pair for Superspeed use.

<p>Can we add this one to a new category, "Comics that Randall makes just to screw with xkcd wiki contributors"?

<dl><dd>Wouldn't be more useful to make a category for comics that Randall DOESN'T make to screw with xkcd wiki contributors?

<p>The claim that a coax has only one conductive part is incorrect.  It has two.  The pin is the inner conductor. The shield is the outer conductor. Without both it wouldn't work.
</p>
<dl><dd>yes, but it's a "pin" out.  Hence, "pin" <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:WhiteDragon" title="User:WhiteDragon">WhiteDragon</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:WhiteDragon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:WhiteDragon (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:37, 9 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'd also say that the claim at the top that a pin can have only one bit or one voltage of power at a time is incorrect.  Power over Ethernet is a perfect example of power and data at the same time.  There are also plenty of types of signals which transmit multiple bits at once.  A simple example would be a signal using four voltage levels to transmit two bits simultaneously, but there are many more fancy analog encodings that use phase and frequency and other characteristics to transmit data. Plus, you can often included two signals on the same conductors. For example, ADSL combined a normal phone signal and a higher frequency data signal on the same lines.  Also cable TV combined many signals on one set of conductors.
</p><p>So, anyway, I'd remove the claim.

<dl><dd>Just because it’s interesting: DCC with RailCom+ allows some cool stuff. It allows many-to-many high-power power transmission, robust many-to-many bidirectional data transmission, hot-swap with automatic configuration and collision resolution, physical position tracking of the connected devices, some way of short-circuit resolution with continued communication, mixing with other protocols, and all with only two pins, which may be arbitrarily interchanged at any time. Admittedly it has a much lower data rate than Power over Ethernet and terrible EMI, but potentially <i>much</i> higher power. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.89.193" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.89.193">162.158.89.193</a> 08:22, 9 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>In addition to pins being able to carry both data and power, or to carry multiple bits at a time, some pins function as clock signal pins that indicate bit boundaries rather than themselves carrying data; therefore I also think the claim should be either omitted or changed entirely.

</p><p>Depending on how you read it, the third pin from the top might match the 120V AC. This would make it a different kind of "tribute" to FireWire... <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ehusmark&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ehusmark (page does not exist)">EHusmark</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ehusmark&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ehusmark (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:52, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>AFAIK FireWire allows many-to-many communication, while USB never did. The FireWire tribute pin could be a way to establish many-to-many communication. Alternatively, FireWire allows daisy-chaining, while USB supports only a tree network trough hubs. The FireWire pin could be somehow physically strange, so a second USB-C cable could be connected to it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.89.193" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.89.193">162.158.89.193</a> 08:22, 9 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The "FireWire tribute pin" bit actually probably was intended to be about the 110V pin.  Providing 110V is, of course, absurd, but FireWire was (I think) the first computer bus to use a relatively high bus voltage to send lots of power over the wire.  The spec actually requires hardware to handle up to 30 VDC.  In fact, I once heard lore about an early prototype PowerMac G4 (I think) that was nicknamed "FireBurner".  Apple built it at one point in the distant past, and actually provided 30V worth of bus power.  They didn't ship that configuration to the public as far as I know, but they used to make it available to companies who wanted to test their FireWire hardware for compatibility.  Unfortunately, a lot of hardware manufacturers in the early days didn't pay attention to that 30V number and assumed that the hardware would always provide 12V like the Macs that had shipped up to that point.  When they actually encountered 30V, a lot of those early devices didn't survive.  <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Dgatwood&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Dgatwood (page does not exist)">Dgatwood</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Dgatwood&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Dgatwood (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:49, 6 August 2020 (UTC)
