<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> has written a song called <i>Every Major's Terrible</i> and this comic illustrates the song. In this song the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(academic)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Major (academic)">Major</a> refers to the US version of an academic major. The point of the song is that it makes no sense to pick any major since they are all terrible!
</p><p>The header notes that the song is written to the tune of the satirical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General%27s_Song" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Major-General&#39;s Song">Major-General's Song</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan%27s" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s">Gilbert and Sullivan's</a> 1879 comic opera <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Pirates of Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i>. The song satirizes the idea of the "modern" educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Major general">Major general</a> is a military rank in the United Kingdom and many other countries. (As of August 2018, the title text has been changed to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhaEjgnmy3c">a link to the said song</a>). The meter in the Major-General's Song is iambic octameter, which means that in each line there are eight iambs, where an iamb is two syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Therefore, each line contains 16 syllables.
</p><p>The panels show Randall's rewritten lyrics to the song. Below each of the three verses are described in detail (go to <a href="#Verse_1">Verse 1</a>, <a href="#Verse_2">Verse 2</a> or <a href="#Verse_3">Verse 3</a>). Each verse ends with "Just put me down as 'Undecided' - Every Major's Terrible", which gives the song its name — and "Major's Terrible" is similar enough to "Major General", the corresponding lyrics in the original version, to serve as a callback. The last line of the first verse in each song goes as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>Original: I am the very model of a modern Major-General</li>
<li>Randall's: Just put me down as undecided- every major's terrible</li></ul>
<p>The lyrics are commonly rewritten, the most famous rewrite likely being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_(song)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Elements (song)">The Elements (song)</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> which is also mentioned below the main header. This song is also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcS3NOQnsQM">available on-line</a>. 
</p><p>His last suggestion, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious">Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious</a>", from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mary Poppins">Mary Poppins</a></i>, is another fast-paced patter-song with a somewhat similar tune, though it doesn't fit quite so well, and the match falls apart at the end of the fourth line, when the "Um-diddly"s start up — still, it's better than nothing.
</p><p>There are at least two performances of this xkcd song online where the transcription is shown to make it easier to understand the text:
</p>
<ul><li>A video with each major acted out by the  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seGpYa8UO0E">SFU Choir - Every Major's Terrible</a>.</li>
<li>A solo with piano: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRexBMPeRTo">Every Major's Terrible' by Ben Miller</a>.
<ul><li>See also this article <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.uproxx.com/gammasquad/2012/08/ben-miller-xkcd-every-majors-terrible/">Xkcd's 'Every Major's Terrible' Is Now A Real Song</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Regarding the title text: "Undeclared" is sometimes called "General Studies". Most U.S. universities will not let you get a degree in this, let alone an advanced degree such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph.D." class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> Also, it should probably be noted that this song refers to U.S.-like university systems, in other countries, one will study little to nothing outside your major, making it more-or-less impossible to be undecided as to major.
</p><p>It should also be noted that the title text fits the cadence of the first line of the song, possibly teasing a fourth verse. As to what that consists of, only Randall knows.

<dl><dt>Panel 1, <i>Philosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> is posing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rodin">Rodin</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Thinker">The Thinker</a>, a common symbol for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Philosophy">philosophy</a>. The equation in the background (two plus light bulb equals sailboat) is nonsense, hence "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Math">math</a> sans rigor, sense or practicality" (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/sans">sans</a> meaning without).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 2, <i>And math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality.</i></dt>
<dd> A cannon is firing. However, instead of going in the normal parabolic arc (a precept of reality and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Physics">physics</a>), the cannonball splits and splits again, so that it looks like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bifurcation diagram">bifurcation diagram</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chaos theory">chaos theory</a>. The dashed line indicates the cannonball's trajectory, which bifurcates twice, although the sum of the momentums of the four resulting (1/4 sized?) cannonballs is presumably mathematically identical to the original.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 3, <i>A business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_education" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Business education">Business</a> is the most common major, often seen as a practical choice applicable to a wide variety of careers, or, as the comic illustrates, preferred by those who just want an easy way to graduate. Cueball gets his diploma and runs away from the dean on the podium while shedding both his robe and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_academic_cap" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Square academic cap">square academic cap</a> (or Mortarboard).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 4, <i>And chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methylacetate.</i></dt>
<dd> Stamp collecting refers to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford">famous quote</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, "All science is either physics or stamp collecting." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_acetate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Methyl acetate">Methyl acetate</a> is a solvent that for instance can be used to remove stamps from their envelope (although water will do the same). The stamps in the background form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Periodic table">periodic table</a> of the chemical elements. And since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chemistry">chemistry</a> is not physics, according to the quote, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemists" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chemists">chemists</a> must be stamp collectors (as, the high on methylacetate, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> wearing goggles and holding an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlenmeyer_flask" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Erlenmeyer flask">Erlenmeyer flask</a>).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 5 and 6, <i>Why anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery</i>, <i>Unless their only other choice were something like art history.</i></dt>
<dd> These lines, both sung by Cueball, refer to subjects where a majority of graduates will end up unemployed or eventually working in a field outside their majors. Topics such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Literature">Literature</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_History" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Art History">Art History</a> are often and historically said to be in this category — although from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3?sort=Rate">actual statistics</a>, it is clear that there are far worse majors these days.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 7 and 8, <i>A BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve</i>, <i>A little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave</i></dt>
<dd> Here Cueball first has a major in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Communication studies">Communications</a> and next he is seen underwater with a basket. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_basket_weaving" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Underwater basket weaving">Underwater basket weaving</a> is a commonly used metaphor for any college major that is easy and/or worthless. "Communications" is a major chosen by people interested in news broadcasting or other media. Note that, if following the original music exactly, the line "A little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave." will be repeated three times by the chorus after these panels.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 9, <i>I'd rather eat a Fowler's toad than major in biology,</i></dt>
<dd> We see Cueball holding a frog out in front of him while taking his hand to his head (in disgust?). A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%27s_toad" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fowler&#39;s toad">Fowler's toad</a> is a relatively common toad in the eastern US, and a stereotype of studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Biology">biology</a> is a frog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dissection">dissection</a>, which is likely part of the reference, albeit oblique. Fowler's Toad emits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufo_fowleri#Behavior" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bufo fowleri">noxious secretion</a> that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/amphibians-reptiles-and-fish/toads.aspx">irritates skin</a> and thus probably also the mucous membranes in the mouth. It would thus be rather painful to eat, making it very bad for Cueball to major in biology since he would rather eat such a toad.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 10, <i>And social psych is worse than either psych </i>or<i> sociology.</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Social psychology">Social psychology</a> is compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sociology">sociology</a> (study of humans in society) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Psychology">psychology</a> (study of human minds). Psychology is represented by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Serial killer">serial killer</a> with a chainsaw, and sociology is represented by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Zombie">zombie</a>. These are to the left of <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a>. To her right is a zombie serial killer with chainsaw. She is standing between them undecided as to take one, the other or both. They are all terrible options...</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 11 and 12, <i>The thought of picking any one of these is too unbearable,</i> <i>Just put me down as "Undecided"—Every major's terrible.</i></dt>
<dd> End of the first verse where Cueball tells his academic advisor that he is undecided as every major's terrible. He even throws away his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_guide" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Study guide">study guide</a>. Every verse ends with some variation of this couplet, and in the original tune, each of these couplets are repeated by the chorus afterwards.</dd>
<dd><i>Unbearable</i> and <i>terrible</i> rhyme for people who have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/r/#Mary.E2.80.93marry.E2.80.93merry_merger" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:English-language vowel changes before historic /r/">Mary-merry merger</a>.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Panel 13, <i>Now, if you can't prognosticate, that's OK in seismology,</i></dt>
<dd><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prognosticate">Prognosticate</a> means "to predict". This refers to the inability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seismology">seismology</a> to reliably predict catastrophic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, even after centuries of extensive research. The panel shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seismic wave">seismic waves</a> from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismograph" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seismograph">seismograph</a>. The seismograph chart has four traces and about halfway across one trace begins oscillating vigorously indicating an earthquake. Five months after this comic was published several seismologists in Italy were <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nature.com/news/italian-court-finds-seismologists-guilty-of-manslaughter-1.11640">convicted of crimes</a> that effectively stemmed from an inability to predict an earthquake. This does not go down well for the message of this panel... Their conviction was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nature.com/news/italian-seismologists-cleared-of-manslaughter-1.16313">overturned on appeal</a> in 2014. </dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 14, <i>But if your hindsight's weak as well, you'd best stick to theology.</i></dt>
<dd> The bearded <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theologist">theologist</a> represents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Theology">Theology</a> by stating the formal logic proposition shown in the illustration: "X ∴ ∃X". This says "I can describe this thing called X, therefore X exists". This is what Anselm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ontological argument">ontological argument</a> for God boils down to. Briefly, it asks you to imagine the best possible deity, which, by definition, would be God. A God which exists in both reality and theory would be greater than one who exists in merely the latter. Therefore, this proposition concludes that God exists. The fatal flaw of this argument is that it can be used to prove the existence of anything (e.g. a vacuum cleaner which exists in both reality and theory is greater than one which exists merely in theory). Just because a perfect God would exist does not mean he does. Thus it has been largely rejected. (See <a href="/wiki/index.php/1505:_Ontological_Argument" title="1505: Ontological Argument">1505: Ontological Argument</a>.)</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 15, <i>CS will make each day a quest to find a missing close-paren.</i></dt>
<dd> "CS" is short for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Science" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computer Science">Computer Science</a>." Most programming languages use parentheses as part of their syntax, and often have multiply-nested parenthetical expressions. This is especially true of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lisp (programming language)">Lisp</a>. It is often difficult for a programmer to determine where the unbalanced parenthesis begins or ends when the code and parentheses are not properly formatted and indented. In the panel there is one more left "(" parenthesis (13) than right ")" or <i>close-paren</i> (12).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 16, <i>Virology will guarantee you'll never get a hug again.</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Virology">Virology</a> is the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_diseases" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Infectious diseases">infectious diseases</a>. The green symbol above the central figure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol#Biohazard_sign" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hazard symbol">biohazard symbol</a>, implying that people who study infectious diseases, and are therefore located near them at some points in time, will be shunned like the plague, because they're probably carrying it. Thus no hugs to Megan as three Cueballs and Ponytail lean back away from her.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 17, <i>I.T. prepares you for a life of fighting with PCs nonstop.</i></dt>
<dd> "I.T." is short for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Information Technology">Information Technology</a>", a degree for people who maintain computer systems. If there is a need for an I.T. position (in which I.T. professionals are employed) there are computers which need fixing — hence the I.T. Professional is always fixing (or fighting) computers, which may or may not have been <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980506">"broken" by users</a>. In the panel Megan, wielding an axe, is in a real fight with a PC.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 18, <i>As Pratchett said, "Geography's just physics slowed with trees on top."</i></dt>
<dd> This is a slightly amended quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Discworld">Discworld</a> author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, from his book "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feet_of_Clay_(novel)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Feet of Clay (novel)"> Feet of Clay</a>". The actual quote is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Geography">Geography</a> is just physics slowed down, with a couple of trees stuck in it." But the meaning is the same, that physics also describes geography - a similar quote to the one about physics vs. stamp collections mentioned under panel 4.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 19, <i>Though physics seems to promise you a Richard Feynman-like career,</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> was a 20th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nobel Prize">Nobel</a>-laureate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Physicist">physicist</a> known for his great sense of humor, including being photographed for one of his books while holding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongo_drum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bongo drum">bongo drum</a>. Here he is depicted with the drum and with both a blond woman and Megan looking admiringly upon him. Feynman made physics seem cool, and many a young fan might choose the subject in the hope of obtaining a Feynman-like career. This is, however, very unlikely for most people as is also shown in the next panel.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 20, <i>The wiki page for "Physics major" redirects to "Engineer."</i></dt>
<dd> A redirect on Wikipedia is a page which immediately sends the visitor to a different page. This implies that the title of the first is either a synonym or a sub-topic of the second. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_major" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Physics major">Physics major</a> usually learn to code, and the standard joke is that they invariably get hired as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computer programmers">computer programmers</a> after graduation, but here in this comic they get hired as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Engineers">engineers</a>. This relates back to the previous panel, as it is here shown that most of those that major in physics end up as engineers and not like Feynman.  The Wikipedia page physics major didn't actually exist when this comic was published. It was created the same day, but as a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_major&amp;redirect=no">redirect</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Physics education">physics education</a>. It is such a redirect page that is shown in the panel. In the subsequent days, there were dozens of instances of people changing it to redirect to engineer, usually reverted within minutes. The redirect page was <i>fully protected</i> and locked for editing. As with the underwater basket-weaving line in the first verse, after the soloist sings this, the line would be repeated three times by the chorus.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 21 and 22, <i>They say to study history or find yourself repeating it,</i> <i>But all that it prepares you for is forty years of teaching it.</i></dt>
<dd> This uses a version of a quote by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:George Santayana">George Santayana</a> (although often attributed to others as well), <i>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it</i> as a reason to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:History">history</a> — only to be followed by an indication that by studying history as a major, you will only be prepared to become a history teacher, and you will then spend the rest of your life teaching history. The first panel shows a flow chart that will lead you to repeat your sad past if you cannot remember it, and only move on to happier times if you can. In the next panel we see a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairbun" title="Hairbun">Hairbun</a> as a history teacher, with glasses and her gray hair tied up in a bun, standing in front of a green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Blackboard">blackboard</a> with three important years for her current history class. (If anyone spots a connection between 1935, 1969 and 1991 please state it here).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>One connection between these years could be pivotal points in Jewish history concerning the formation of nationality: the Nurenberg Laws of 1935 removing citizenship from Jews in Germany, Israel's claims on Jerusalem, and the UN Security Council's condemnation of the treatment of Palestines by Israel.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>A more lighthearted connection, more in line with the message of learning from history, is the collapse of three notable communications towers: the wooden radio tower in Langenberg in 1935 (by tornado), a TV mast at Emley Moor in 1969 (due to ice build-up), and the Warsaw radio mast in 1991 (due to construction errors). This demonstrates various attempts and failures to learn from engineering mistakes from the past, connecting this with the earlier mentioning of physicists becoming engineers, and perhaps not taking real-world practical considerations into account (such as storms or ice build-up).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Of course, in practice, with a narrow enough subject, there are likely to be many more examples fitting these three years. The two examples above were from general world history.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 23 and 24, <i>I recognize my four-year plan's at this point not repairable,</i> <i>But put me down as "Undecided"—Every major's terrible.</i></dt>
<dd> End of the second verse where Cueball again talks to his academic advisor saying that he is undecided. In the last of the two panel he says almost the same as at the end of the first verse. In the first, however, he mentioned his "four-year plan" which is the list of all the courses a student plans to include in their degree program. If you change majors every semester, or do not decide on one until too late, this list gets really difficult to turn into any one degree. Again these lines would be repeated by the chorus afterwards.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Panel 25, <i>Astronomers all cringe when they hear "supermoon" or "zodiac".</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supermoon">Supermoon</a> is a term invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astrologers">astrologers</a> in the 1970s, with no significance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astronomy">astronomy</a> other than being the co-occurrence of orbital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Perigee">perigee</a> and full-moon. But it comes up often in the press, linked to supernatural behavior. That also Randall dislikes seems realistic and he also "mocked" the term soon after in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1080:_Visual_Field" title="1080: Visual Field">1080: Visual Field</a> and then finally confirmed what he thought about the term directly when he published <a href="/wiki/index.php/1394:_Superm*n" title="1394: Superm*n">1394: Superm*n</a>. This was the first comic referencing supermoon, here is <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Supermoon" title="Category:Supermoon">a list</a> of all such comics. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Zodiac">zodiac</a> is the circular band in the sky containing the apparent path of the sun, moon and planets.  Most often when people talk about it, they're referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astrology">astrology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscopes" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Horoscopes">horoscopes</a> and other pseudo-scientific notions which often lead to conversations which are frustrating to astronomers, like the bearded one from the panel.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 26, <i>Agronomy's a no-go; I'm a huge agorophobiac.</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Agronomy">Agronomy</a> is the science of farming, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoraphobia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a> is the fear of wide open spaces. Fields, where most farming happens, are wide open spaces. In the panel an anxious Cueball is standing near a fence on an open field with a tractor. Presumably he may be OK inside the tractor, but once he gets outside he becomes anxious.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 27, <i>I'm too ophiophobic to consider herpetology,</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Herpetology">Herpetology</a> is the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptiles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Reptiles">reptiles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibians" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Amphibians">amphibians</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiophobia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ophiophobia">ophiophobia</a> is the fear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Snakes">snakes</a> (a reptile). The panel shows sweating Cueball holding his hands to his mouth while looking at a green snake asking for his love? It is possible that Cueball is afraid of the snake, who is harmless and just wants to be friends.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 28, <i>And I can't stomach any part of gastroenterology.</i></dt>
<dd> As the pun suggests, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gastroenterology">gastroenterology</a> is the study of the human digestive system and the image shows the human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stomach">stomach</a>. To <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/cannot+stomach">not be able to stomach something</a> means you can't stand or tolerate this thing. </dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 29, <i>While pre-med gives you twitchy-eyed obsession with your GPA,</i></dt>
<dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-med" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pre-med">Pre-med</a> (pre-medical) is a major chosen by students hoping to go on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Medical school">medical school</a> to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Medicine">medicine</a> and eventually become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Doctor of Medicine">doctors</a>. Medical school is extremely competitive and usually requires a very high undergraduate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:GPA">GPA</a> for prospective students. Hence we see a pre-med student holding all his grades.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panel 30, <tt>a poetry degree bespeaks bewildering naïveté.</tt></dt>
<dd> The text is in all lower-case, a different font and strangely laid out compared to the text in all the other panels. All-lower-case and "free" layout are both associated with 20th century "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Modernist">Modernist</a>" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Poetry">poetry</a>, especially the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:E. E. Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>. Ponytail is actually reciting this line of the song.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 31 and 32, <i>TV's behind the rush into forensic criminology</i>, <i>(Or so claims meta-academic epidemiology).</i></dt>
<dd> This refers to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Forensic">forensic</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Criminology">criminology</a> shows, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Miami" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:CSI: Miami">CSI: Miami</a> (Crime Scene Investigation: Miami) as shown on the TV screen in both panels, often dramatize, exaggerate or otherwise confuse the science behind forensics; this gives people unrealistically glamorous views of the career, thus encouraging them to join it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Epidemiology">Epidemiology</a> is the study of causes and effects of events and trends. We see a pipe smoking epidemiologist standing with Ponytail and watching CSI - presumably making wild claims on cause and effect based only on what they see on TV. This is, again, the point where the chorus joins in three times, as in the previous two verses.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Panels 33 and 34, <i>By dubbing econ "dismal science" adherents exaggerate;</i> <i>The "dismal"'s fine - it's "science" where they patently prevaricate.</i></dt>
<dd> "Econ" is short for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Economics">economics</a>".  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Thomas Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> declared economics "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dismal_science" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The dismal science">the dismal science</a>" in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Victorian era">Victorian era</a> as a derogatory alternative name. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economists" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Economists">Economists</a> often claim that economics is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Science">science</a> like any other; however, as the predictive powers of all economic theories are exceedingly weak compared to those of any science, this is disputed by those outside the field at times. It is of course also disputed by this song, in which Cueball "clearly" (see below) states that economics should not call itself a science - that is the <i>dismal science</i> is not derogatory enough for him. </dd></dl>
<ul><li>The sentences uttered by Cueball in these two panels are extremely difficult English for non-native English speakers. </li>
<li>Here is some help in understanding the sentences:
<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dub">Dubbing</a> something means <i>giving it a nickname</i>.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dismal">Dismal</a> science means (in this context) <i>the disappointingly inadequate science</i>.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adherent">Adherents</a> means <i>supporters</i>.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patently">Patently</a> means <i>in a clear and unambiguous manner</i></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prevaricate">Prevaricate</a> means to <i>evade the truth</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Using these meanings of the words the two sentences can be re-written as:
<ul><li>By giving economics the nickname "the inadequate science" the supporters [of economics] exaggerate;</li>
<li>The "inadequate" is fine - it's "science" where they evade the truth in a clear and unambiguous manner.</li></ul></li>
<li>That is, Cueball is saying that "inadequate science" is too nice of a term for economics, he thinks it's not even science at all.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>Panels 35, <i>In terms of choices, I'd say only Sophie's was comparable.</i></dt>
<dt>Panels 36, <i>Just put me down as "Undecided"—Every major's terrible!</i></dt>
<dd> End of the third verse, with yet another variant on the closing couplet. Choosing a major is compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sophie&#39;s Choice">Sophie's Choice</a>, which is any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dilemma">dilemma</a> where choosing one cherished person or thing over the other will result in the death or destruction of the other, derived from the theme of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice_(novel)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sophie&#39;s Choice (novel)">novel</a> of the same name, which has also been turned into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sophie&#39;s Choice (film)">romantic drama film</a>. So Cueball tells the academic advisor that choosing any of the majors over any other is as horrible as to have to choose which cherished person should die to save the other. Although in his case, it is the other way around, since he thinks all choices suck. Again these lines would be repeated by the chorus.</dd></dl>

<p>In panel 22 (History), what's the theme connecting the years 1935, 1969, and 1991?

</p>
<dl><dd>1935 is certainly related to some event that lead to the WWII (a quick look at the Wikipedia page for 1935 show that was the year Hitler rearmed Germany), which paved the way to the Cold War. 1969 was Apollo 11, a high moment of the Cold War, as the USA essentially won the race to the Moon. And 1991 was the year that the USSR dissolved, officially ending the Cold War. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Sir_labreck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sir labreck (page does not exist)">Sir labreck</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_labreck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sir labreck (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:37, 11 August 2015 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>1935, Harlem race riot; 1969, race riot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; 1991, Rodney King race riots... 2014-2016??? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.62" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.62">173.245.54.62</a> 03:33, 13 December 2015 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Although the race riot dates match, I think war related is more likely.  1935 (WWII), 1969 (Vietnam), 1991 (Gulf War) I'm not sure what the common thread is, though, and 'war' is too broad <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.250.4" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.250.4">172.69.250.4</a> 20:37, 30 September 2018 (UTC)

<p>This explanation is very small for that big comic. I am starting to add the transcript and after that I will do more investigations to that opera.

<dl><dd>The answer won't lie in the song, trust me. Pirates of Penzance is probably my favorite comic opera out there. Plus Randall gives that the lie in saying you can use the tune from the elements song (a well-known parody) or even Marry Poppins (similar tune, but not exactly the same). I think each panel is just a reference to the words, I don't think that Randall is actually involving The Pirates of Penzance in any way other than the tune. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.211" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.211">173.245.52.211</a> 20:53, 9 December 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>"Math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality" - that isn't a binary tree, its a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram">bifurcation diagram</a> from chaos theory.  And, sorry, it has nothing to do with the Banach–Tarski paradox - that's just mindless name-dropping.

<dl><dd>Are you sure it is not just an illustration of Banach-Tarski, arguably the most  famous example where mathematical reality and (physical) intuition diverge? Why would the verse be illustrated by a bifurcation diagram (which I think, and I might be a bit ignorant here, is a concept pretty much only found in the "applied side" of mathematics, which <i>is</i> constrained by precepts of reality)? And even if it were a bifurcation diagram, why would the mass of the balls change? (again, I am perhaps showcasing my ignorance; if so, please be gentle) Finally, i would deem the bifurcation explanation a bit too obscure to be the real deal - a panel which is only understood by somewhat specialized mathematicians seems strange to me, especially given that all other frames contain understandable references. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.229.183" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.229.183">108.162.229.183</a> 13:38, 9 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

I think that the reason for not getting hugs in panel 16 is more to do with the fact that as a virus researcher you would be aware of how easy it is to get a virus/disease and so you would keep away from people and be worried about hugs because of that.
