<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Map projection">Map projection</a>, or how to represent the spherical Earth surface onto a flat support (paper, screen...) to have a usable map, is a long-time issue with very practical aspects (navigation, geographical shapes and masses visualization, etc.) as well as very scientific/mathematical ones, involving geometry or even abstract algebra among other things. There is no universal solution to this problem: Any 2D map projection will always distort in a way the spherical reality. Many projections have been proposed in various contexts, each intending to minimize distortions for specific uses (for nautical navigation, for aerial navigation, for landmass size comparisons, etc.) but having drawbacks from other points of view. Some of them are more frequently used than others in mass media and therefore more well-known than others, some are purely historical and now deprecated, some are very obscure, etc.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> suggests here the idea that someone's "favorite" map projection can reveal aspects of their personality, then goes through a series of them to show what they can mean. 
</p><p>He may actually believe that all map projections are in a way bad. This could be inferred from the fact that he much later began  publishing a series of <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Bad_Map_Projections" title="Category:Bad Map Projections">Bad Map Projections</a>.

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:272px;"><a href="/wiki/index.php/File:MercatorProjection.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/3/33/MercatorProjection.jpg" width="270" height="247" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption">The Mercator projection</div></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mercator projection">Mercator projection</a> was introduced by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. The main purpose of this map is to preserve compass bearings; for example 13 degrees east of north will be 13 degrees clockwise from the ray pointing toward the top of the map, at every point.  A mathematical consequence is the mapping is conformal, i.e. if two roads meet at a certain angle on the surface of the Earth, they will meet at that same angle on the map.  It also follows that at every point the vertical and horizontal scales are the same, so locally i.e. considering only a small part of the map, geographical features (shapes, angles) are well represented, which helps a lot in recognizing them on-the-field, or for local navigation in that small part only. For this reason, that projection (or a close variant) is used in several online mapping services (such as Google Maps), which means that it is frequently encountered by the general public. A straight line on the map corresponds to a course of constant bearing (direction), which was very useful for nautical navigation in the past (and thus made that projection very well-known).
</p><p>However, from a global point of view, this projection is radically incorrect in how it shows the size of landmasses (for instance, Antarctica and Greenland seem gigantic), and furthermore, it always excludes a small region around each pole (otherwise the map would be of infinite height), so it doesn't provide a complete solution for the problem of map projection. The comic implies that people who like that projection aren't very interested with map issues, and typically use what they are offered without thinking much about it.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Grinten_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Van der Grinten projection">Van der Grinten projection</a> is not much better than the Mercator. It was adopted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:National Geographic">National Geographic</a> in 1922 and was used until they updated to the Robinson projection in 1988.
</p><p>The Van der Grinten projection is circular as opposed to the Mercator projection. The fictional person believes a circular map is more fitting to the real Earth's three-dimensional spherical nature because both are round. This belief fails to recognize that a two-dimensional circle has very little in common with the surface of a sphere, and thus this projection still causes a vast distortion of space and area.  Because of this, Randall implies the Van der Grinten enthusiast to be optimistic and childishly simple-minded (e.g. "you like circles").

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Robinson projection">Robinson projection</a> was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_H._Robinson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arthur H. Robinson">Arthur H. Robinson</a> as a map that was supposed to look nice and is often used for classroom maps. National Geographic switched to this projection in 1988, and used it for ten years, switching to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Winkel tripel projection">Winkel-Tripel</a> in 1998.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Beatles">The Beatles</a> was a rock band that enjoyed great commercial success in the 1960s, and are widely considered the best act ever in the genre of popular music. The Beatles, coffee, and running shoes are all things that are very commonly enjoyed and largely uncontroversial, as well as being comforting.  Liking these specific things suggests an ordinary, easygoing lifestyle paralleled by the projection.

<p>Also called the Fuller Map, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dymaxion map">Dymaxion map</a> takes a sphere and projects it onto an icosahedron, that is a polyhedron with 20 triangular faces. It is far easier to unwrap an icosahedron than it is to unwrap a sphere into a 2D object and has very little skewing of the poles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Buckminster Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> was an eccentric futurist who believed, for example, that world maps should allow no conception of "up" or "down". He was therefore more than happy to defy people's expectations about maps in the pursuit of mathematical accuracy.
</p><p>Randall associates the projection to geek subculture and niche markets:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> was an American science-fiction writer, who (as well as publishing many textbooks) is considered the father of the modern concept of robots. He invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Three Laws of Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>. He also worked on more than 500 books throughout his career.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:XML">XML</a> is the eXtensible Markup Language. It is used to represent data in a format that machines can read and understand, as well as being human-readable. In practice, XML is cumbersome to read.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibram_FiveFingers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vibram FiveFingers">Toed shoes</a> are a <a href="/wiki/index.php/1065:_Shoes" title="1065: Shoes">favorite</a> of Randall's to pick on. In society they are seen as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Geek">geek</a> clothing item.</li>
<li>Brought to the world by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dean Kamen">Dean Kamen</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_PT" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Segway PT">Segway PT</a> was supposed to be a device that changed the way cities were built. In reality, most jurisdictions have put in place rules specifically against Segways, making them a frustration to own and use within the law (in some states in Australia, it is illegal to use them on public footpaths or roads). Also, the former owner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc." class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Segway Inc.">Segway Inc.</a>, the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Heselden" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jimi Heselden">Jimi Heselden</a>, accidentally rode his Segway off a cliff in 2010. Ninebot, then owner of the Segway brand, announced in 2020 that the flagship 2-wheeled self-balancing vehicle would be discontinued.</li>
<li>At the time of comic release, 3D goggles, nowadays widely known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Virtual reality headset">VR headsets</a>, were considered a gimmick at best. The original idea is as old as 3D graphics, but it never really took off until mid-2010s. Earlier products were very unwieldy and offered poor graphics quality, so no one took this technology seriously.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dvorak Simplified Keyboard">Dvorak</a> is an alternate keyboard layout to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:QWERTY">QWERTY</a>. According to legend, QWERTY was invented to help keep manual typewriters from jamming (by placing the most used keys far from each other) but Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Dvorak" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:August Dvorak">August Dvorak</a> performed many studies and found the mathematically optimal keyboard layout to reduce finger travel for right handed typists. While some claim Dvorak is technically better than QWERTY, QWERTY had become the standard. Most keyboards were laid out in QWERTY format, but a lot of software exists to remap the keys to DVORAK for those interested in typing faster.  Retraining the brain to use Dvorak takes perhaps a week.  It has become a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Dvorak" title="Category:Dvorak">recurrent theme</a> on xkcd.</li></ul>

<p>Proposed by Oswald Winkel in 1921, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Winkel tripel projection">Winkel tripel projection</a> tried to reduce a set of three (German: Tripel) main problems with map projections: area, direction, and distance. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavrayskiy_VII_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kavrayskiy VII projection">Kavrayskiy projection</a> is very similar to the Winkel Tripel and was used by the USSR, but very few in the Western world know of it.
</p><p>The comic links this projection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hipster">hipster</a> subculture. The hipster stereotype is to avoid conforming to mainstream fashions. "Post-" refers to a variety of musical genres such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Post-punk">post-punk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-grunge" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Post-grunge">post-grunge</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-minimalism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Post-minimalism">post-minimalism</a>, etc. that branch off of other genres.

<ul><li>In German "Winkel-Tripel-Projektion" means Winkel's triple projection, and therefore the hyphen shouldn't be there: "Winkel Tripel" or "Winkel tripel".</li>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goode_homolosine_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Goode homolosine projection">Goode homolosine projection</a> takes a different approach to skewing a sphere into a roughly circular surface. An orange peel can be taken from an orange and flattened with fair success; this is roughly the procedure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paule_Goode" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:John Paule Goode">John Paule Goode</a> followed in creating this projection. Randall is suggesting that people who like this map also prefer relatively easy solutions to other things in life, despite those solutions having nuanced problems that are more difficult to address.
</p><p>People often make arguments that if normal people ran the United States, then the US wouldn't be in the trouble it is. This is from the belief that career politicians are simply out to make money and will only act in the interest of their constituency when their continued easy life is threatened (usually around election time).
</p><p>Airline food is another, much maligned, problem. How do you store enough food to feed people on long airplane trips? What kind of food can be served in an enclosed, low-air-pressure environment? The common solution is to use some kind of prepackaged, reheated meal. Randall is saying that the people in favor of the Goode Homolosine wonder why the airlines don't simply order meals from the restaurants in the airport, store that food, and serve it, rather than using bland reheated food. However, this seemingly-obvious solution ignores how being in an airplane dulls your sense of taste. Airplane food is actually overseasoned for eating on the ground, meaning that if airlines switched to restaurant food it would probably taste even blander.
</p><p>Older cars burned oil like mad fiends, and oil back then would become corrosive to the innards of an engine, so oil had to be changed often. But, with the introduction of synthetic motor oil and better designed engines, new cars only need their oil changed about every 10,000 to 15,000 miles. A common conspiracy theory is that modern automobile oil manufacturers still recommend that car owners change their oil every 3,000-5,000 miles to "drum" up more business, even though that frequency is unnecessary.
</p><p>All of these references suggest that people who like the Goode Homolosine projection are fans of easy solutions to problems. However, the solutions would not necessarily work in practice. For instance: the restaurants might have trouble making enough food for the whole plane, and it could get cold before being served; the air conditions <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/one-reason-airline-food-so-bad-your-own-tastebuds-6C10823522">aboard planes</a> can affect taste, so airlines say they optimize for this; there is no such thing as a "normal" person, and if there were, he/she would have virtually no chance at actually getting into government office; and the Goode Homolosine projection, while mostly resembling a flattened orange peel as suggested by the earlier analogy, does indeed cut down on distortion, but also has serious problems of its own, such as leaving huge gaps of nothingness between the continents, making distances across the oceans difficult to visualize.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo%E2%80%93Dyer_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hobo–Dyer projection">Hobo–Dyer projection</a> was commissioned by Bob Abramms and Howard Bronstein and was drafted by Mick Dyer in 2002. It is a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behrmann_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Behrmann projection">Behrmann projection</a>. The goal was to be a more visually pleasing version of the Gall–Peters.
</p><p>As is discussed in the Gall–Peters explanation, the Gall–Peters was developed to be equal area, so that economically disadvantaged areas can at least take comfort in the fact that their country is represented correctly by area on maps.
</p><p>Randall associates the Hobo–Dyer projection to "crunchy granola" — a stereotype associated with vegetarianism, environmental activism, anti-war activism, liberal political leanings, and some traces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hippie">hippie</a> culture.
</p><p>With feminism becoming mainstream and alternative genders being more widely accepted, some have begun to invent gender-neutral pronouns so that when referring to a person whose gender is not known they cannot be offended by being referred to by the wrong pronouns. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Middle English">Middle English</a> 'they' and 'their' were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Singular they">accepted genderless pronouns that could replace 'he', 'she'</a> as well as be used to represent a crowd, but this usage is considered by some to be grammatically incorrect because of the plural/singular debate (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/video/the-awkward-case-of-his-or-her">stupid Victorian Grammarians!</a>). There have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun#Invented_pronouns" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gender-neutral pronoun">many attempts at popularizing invented gender-neutral pronouns</a> and they are beginning to achieve some degree of success in the mainstream.

<p>In any good discussion there has to be at least one smart-ass. This is a comic about map projections, that is, the science of taking a sphere and flattening it into 2 dimensions.

</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Inception">Inception</a> was a 2010 movie about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Meta">meta</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lucid dream">lucid dreaming</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gall–Peters projection">Gall–Peters projection</a> is mired in controversy, surprisingly for a map. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gall" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:James Gall">James Gall</a>, a 19th-century clergyman, presented this projection in 1855 before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:British Association for the Advancement of Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>. In 1967, the filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Peters" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arno Peters">Arno Peters</a> created the same projection and presented it to the world as a "new invention" that put poorer, less powerful countries into their rightful proportions (as opposed to the Mercator). Peters played the marketing game and got quite a few followers of his map by saying it had "absolute angle conformality," "no extreme distortions of form," and was "totally distance-factual" in an age when society was very concerned about social justice. All of these claims were in fact false. The Mercator projection distorts size in favor of shape, and Gall-Peters distorts shape in favor of size, being especially inaccurate at the equator and the poles.
</p><p>The implication is that the fans of this map are pompously concerned with social justice, and willing either to lie or convey marketing mistruths to promote that cause. Alternatively Randall just dislikes this map projection so much due to the above mentioned inaccuracies, that he hates anyone who likes it.

Well if you open up both links you will see they are at different zoom levels, one at a scale of 50 feet per unit and the other at 100 feet so yes being twice the zoom the cars are going to appear larger then the image right next to it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.62.231" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.62.231">162.158.62.231</a> 12:04, 23 August 2017 (UTC)

</p><p>The common video game trope of "the far east of the world is connected to the far west, and the far north likewise to the far south" is popularly resolved by saying that those game worlds are toroidal shapes. (For a particular reference, I am thinking of the SNES and PSX era Final Fantasy games (4-9.)) But sometime in the last year, I got the idea that you could also resolve that geographical conflict (and claim they are spherical) by the logic that the "world map" you see in those games (where they have one) is a Peirce Qunincuncial map. Is my logic sound? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Boct1584&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Boct1584 (page does not exist)">Boct1584</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Boct1584&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Boct1584 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:31, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Wow, I looked into it and it really seems like an excellent projection. It's been a while since I've looked at projections but I think it's my new favourite as it has everything that I've been looking for in a projection. It's a more accurate (in extremes) and more pleasing Robinson projection that still has a reasonable amount cut off the top. Also, the indicatrix for it is very simple, as is the formula, and simple things please simple minds (like mine, apparently) -- without taking it to an extreme like the equirectangular projection does. I swear I've come across it before, but then again I grew up in a country which wasn't far from the Eastern Bloc. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.214" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.214">141.101.98.214</a> 14:51, 5 November 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
