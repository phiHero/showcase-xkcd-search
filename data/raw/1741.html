<p>This comic details a set of theoretical examples of how much work went into the design and manufacture of everyday objects. See explanation of <a href="#Individual_design_elements">individual design elements</a> below. 
</p><p>The joke centers around the fact that most people in modern times are constantly surrounded with human-built objects, which we generally use without giving them much thought. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> implies that he occasionally imagines what went into seemingly simple objects around him (in this case his desk and the water glass and the desk lamp on top of it), and finds it overwhelming. This is because there are so many built items around us, many of which are inexpensive and mass-produced, which nonetheless resulted from a great deal of human effort. 
</p><p>This is similar to the thesis of the classic essay <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html">I, Pencil</a></i>, except that while <i>I, Pencil</i> idealizes manufacture and commerce to argue for the free market and against regulation, the comic focuses on details that are far more human or based in bureaucratic or government red tape.
</p><p>Presumably, this kind of realization is more likely for people who've worked in design and engineering, like Randall, because they have some insight into what's involved in bringing a product to market. Also people who sit around all day wondering what could be funny, like Randall, could also end up in such a thought spiral. The comment about California recalls is based on the tags on products that often state "This item has been known by the state of California to cause..."<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65">[1]</a>
</p><p>There's a double joke in the title as the first thing most people will think of, when seeing such a table with a typical desk lamp, is that this is a <i>work desk</i> rather than about all the <b>work</b> put into making the desk and lamp. The potential implication is that Randall is so distracted imagining the work that went into creating his workspace that he can't get his own work done, hence the title. (Interestingly, but without being related to this comic, the next comic was called <a href="/wiki/index.php/1742:_Will_It_Work" title="1742: Will It Work">1742: Will It <b>Work</b></a>).
</p><p>The argument over putting the switch on the cord getting someone fired hits on another aspect of the design issue. Companies that design and manufacture goods will inevitably have human conflicts, where decisions will be argued over, and human personalities and office politics will impact the final design. 
</p><p>In the title text Randall states that this incidence is imaginary (based on his imagination) but still he has apparently come up with an entire fictional narrative about the conflict over whether to put the lamp's switch on the lamp body itself, or to attach it to the lamp's power cord. And now he has SUCH a strong opinion about the firing incident. 
</p><p>This may be because he already had a strong opinion about who was right, which could make him angry if that person was the one getting fired. Randall's distaste for lamps where the switch is on the cord was mentioned in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1036:_Reviews" title="1036: Reviews">1036: Reviews</a>. As the lamp on this desk is with the switch on the cord, and as it seems Randall really dislikes such lamps, this would make sense, as it would probably be the one wishing to put the switch on the body who were fired. Alternatively it could have been the one who put the switch on the wire that was fired later, when they got poor on-line reviews... 
</p><p>Using the lamp as shown on this desk would make it annoying with the switch on the cord, as it will be hard to reach under the table, when sitting at the desk. Often such lamps have the switch either at the main body or on the head of the lamp. That would make it easy to reach it while sitting at the desk.
</p><p>A similar theme of the unseen contributions of engineers is found in <a href="/wiki/index.php/277:_Long_Light" title="277: Long Light">277: Long Light</a>, including the title text: "You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.' It's a little human connection." This fits in well with Randall's annoyance with a switch on the cord, as he might believe it was a frustrated engineer that is the cause of such an inconvenient placement of the switch.

<td>9 hours of meetings </td>
<td> Any product development requires several meetings about coordination for any aspect of the design, especially critical ones that can affect other subsystems in the device, such as the flexible stem in this lamp. Its size is affected by the wiring requirements, strength requirements, intersections with both the base and the lamp head. The material, properties, color, manufacturing process, and so on also have to be determined for something as simple as this.

<td>Ongoing debate </td>

<tr>
<td>Years-long negotiation with glass supplier </td>
<td> Many products have to go through many stages of negotiations before the company can have the required supplies to build the product. This is a commentary on how long it takes to negotiate with other supplier businesses about things that the average consumer sees trivial: it <i>can</i> take months or years when outsourcing to determine and contract which kind of glass, how much, what price, what happens when base materials change in price, what other kinds of glass are acceptable, what compounds are allowed around the glass during production, etc. etc.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4 hours of meetings </td>
<td> It takes several meetings for the design team to fully determine and justify what size is best for the market, and to relay this information to the rest of the company. Then, they receive feedback on what is or isn't acceptable, frequently by people who don't know exactly <i>why</i>, so they have to return again for another meeting for further clarification.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Months of tip-over testing </td>
<td> The thicker the base of a glass is, the lower its center of gravity is, and the heavier it is. A balance between stability and ease of handling must be reached. In addition, testing generally takes longer than the consumer expects, and every variation must be tested to determine which one performs the most acceptably.

<td>Argument over putting switch on cord got someone fired </td>
<td> Some people can become quite passionate about whether a particular feature is, on balance, a convenience or an annoyance. If the designers cannot find a compromise or reach consensus, the supervisor may decide that the time spent on these disagreements outweighs the value of the passionate designers.

<p>To prevent fire hazards, objects in California are not allowed to surpass a certain temperature, 140 °C if I'm correct . Can't find the actual law quick. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.114.230" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.114.230">162.158.114.230</a> 18:01, 3 October 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I think Randall underestimates the problem.  I used to work for the research arm of the electronics multinational, Philips.  When a product design was "finished", it had to go to a special committee who decided where, exactly, on the product did the word "PHILIPS" and their little shield logo go - and (rarely) whether these things should be done in black or white.  It was VERY frequently the case that the committee would take longer to come to a conclusion than the product took to design. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:SteveBaker" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:SteveBaker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:SteveBaker (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:32, 3 October 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I often wonder about those tiny, cheap plastic toys that come in Xmas crackers (UK) or the 25 cent toy vending machines (USA).  They are completely crappy things - but thinking that someone thought about what kind of toy should be made - then designed the shape of it, thought about the color of plastic to use, spent tens of thousands of dollars machining an injection mold for it - and STILL turned out a complete piece of junk...it's anyone's guess what effort that took.  I know it costs around $40,000 to make a mold like that - but those toys look like someone who was being paid very, very little, spent no more than an afternoon designing each one!  <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:SteveBaker" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:SteveBaker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:SteveBaker (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:32, 3 October 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>I don't know anything about glass production, but is it true that "what compounds are allowed around the glass during production" matters?   It sounds like those martini recipes where one waves a bottle of vermouth towards the glass.   <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Miamiclay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Miamiclay (page does not exist)">Miamiclay</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Miamiclay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Miamiclay (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:47, 4 October 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I'm no expert, but if impurities gets into the glass the color or refraction may change or the strength. And if it is a drinking glass there may be any kind of toxic products that may be used in creating window glass etc. that could not be allowed to enter the production. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:37, 4 October 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I wouldn't call myself an expert on glass in cups, either, but I've learned about FDA guidelines, studied manufacturing processes, and visited a glass production company once. The FDA has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/garden/fda-issues-warnings-on-using-lead-crystal.html">issued a warning</a> on lead crystal glass cups, and lead has been found in regular glass, and as you said there are many contaminants that can be present during manufacturing from any material but if the material comes in contact with food or drink (such as cups) special care has to be taken to avoid those toxins. I am not 100% sure this is done with drinking glass, but it makes sense. Even if nobody cares about getting toxins in drinking glasses, this comic is about "imaging the work that went into design" and not "knowing exactly what went into design". <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Jeudi_Violist" title="User:Jeudi Violist">Jeudi Violist</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeudi_Violist&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jeudi Violist (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:57, 5 October 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>My favourite (fake) dry martini recipe included having a friend in Hong Kong (the writer was based in Britain) whisper the word "Vermouth" over the 'phone, whilst the handset was held close (but not too close) to the Gin!<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:RoyT&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RoyT (page does not exist)">RoyT</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:RoyT&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:RoyT (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:37, 5 October 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Randall may, indeed, be annoyed about the cord switch, but there is nothing in the comic or the title text to suggest that. He does, however, have a strong opinion on the "cord switch _firing_ incident". Perhaps that bit of the explanation should be amended? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:RoyT&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RoyT (page does not exist)">RoyT</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:RoyT&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:RoyT (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:48, 4 October 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think they say that because he implied in the title text of a previous comic that having the switch on the cord is worse than having your dog possessed by a demon. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.218.136" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.218.136">108.162.218.136</a> 11:43, 4 October 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Both are true. I have corrected the explanation to say that he is upset about the firing. And then by referring to the old comic makes sense of why he might have such a strong op--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:37, 4 October 2016 (UTC)inion.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Removed an abusive and trolling "disclaimer" asking us to evaluate our life choices and our support of the comic.

</p><p>I think about design a lot and however many hours are spent on some products it never ceases to amaze me how the primary feature can fail so terribly, like pouring a liquid without the liquid spilling. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.215.235" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.215.235">108.162.215.235</a> 00:42, 5 October 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>It's a bit strange to emphasize the work that went into designing these things, but to completely fail to mention to work that went in to *actually* making them.

</p><p>An engineer worked into the night? Maybe if the engineer had let a draftsman do the job for him all that time could have been saved. Mind you, ACAD is a drawing package.

<dl><dd>Huh? How so? I can buy all of those products in a store today, and while yes, the general products were in existence before/around the '50s, the Korean company that made my el-cheapo dollar store versions had to make the designs from scratch.
