<p>This interactive comic is similar to <a href="/wiki/index.php/2712:_Gravity" title="2712: Gravity">2712: Gravity</a>, which celebrated the release of <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/What_If%3F_2" title="What If? 2">What If? 2</a></i>, as you can visit different planets. Your fuel runs out and recharges slowly over time or instantly whenever you land. Like in Gravity, there is no "universal" point of view: the bottom of the window, "down", is oriented towards the object exerting the most gravity upon the player.
</p><p>You begin on the Starting Planet, near Origin. To escape Origin's gravitational force, gain enough momentum by swinging a few times inside the large hidden tunnel that goes from the rollercoaster to the opposing side of the planet. To help you find other planets there are also many small circles surrounding the spaceship indicating the locations of nearby or distant planets depending on how transparent these points are. Collecting circles with a star outline will improve the performance of the spaceship, such as by making the engine more efficient or increasing the rate at which the fuel recharges, and sometimes make you find a new item. Collecting small grey circles will instead just make you find an item, such as a rock with neat stripes, a cool bug, and a pretty leaf.
</p><p>Most planets and celestial objects are inside of a large Crystal Sphere in which there is a visible navigable crack. Halfway through the crack, gravity gets increasingly stronger as the spaceship feels the gravitational force of the  parts of the Crystal Sphere it is leaving behind. Above the crack in the Crystal Sphere, there is the Star Destroyer from <a href="/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard" title="1608: Hoverboard">1608: Hoverboard</a>, and on the opposite side of the crack, there is a huge part of the world in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1110:_Click_and_Drag" title="1110: Click and Drag">1110: Click and Drag</a> in the form of a round planet.
</p><p>The title of the comic is likely a reference to the 1996 computer game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Escape Velocity (video game)">Escape Velocity</a>, which also featured a 2D map dotted with planets. The title text says, "Gotta go fast.", a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>'s catchphrase, and the point of the game: getting able to go faster to escape larger and larger planets and leave the Crystal Sphere.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Hyperdrive">The Hyperdrive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=2765:_Escape_Speed&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: The Hyperdrive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Hyperdrive is a powerful upgrade to the spaceship that massively boosts your thrusters. It is found at the center of the Boston Planet and is needed to explore the planets outside the Crystal Sphere and to escape from the black hole inside the Subway Planet. It can only be unlocked after deactivating the MIT Cloaking Device on the Subway Planet and collecting three of the four subway tokens found at different "Bostons". Subway tokens are circles with a T outline, and they have a distinct color: "blue", "red", "green", and "orange", the four colors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBTA_subway" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:MBTA subway">Boston's subway system</a>. The blue token on the Boston Planet is not strictly necessary to get the Hyperdrive, although it is the easiest to obtain. Note that getting it will require several other upgrades first, so it shouldn't be your first objective. See <a href="#Celestial_Bodies_and_Collectable_Items">the table below</a> for other ways to progress in the game.
</p><p>Here's how to get the Hyperdrive:
</p>
<ol><li> Get to the Subway Planet by launching from the bush where someone says "Shhh." on Origin. () The Subway Planet features all the subways of North America except Boston, which has been ripped out and hidden by the MIT kids, leaving a big empty hole in the crust of the planet.</li>
<li> Once on the Subway Planet, go to Morgantown, WV via Mexico City and Atlanta, and deactivate the MIT Cloaking Device to make the Boston Planet appear.</li>
<li> Follow the two intangible grey lines that will first guide you to Origin and then the Roche Lobe Earth (one of the four Bostons) and collect the green subway token on it.</li>
<li> Go back to Origin and collect the orange token on the Guitar Ship (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2765:_Escape_Speed#Celestial_Bodies_and_Collectable_Items">the table below</a> for instructions on how to find these planets).</li>
<li> Get to the East Coast of the US on the Projection of Earth and collect the red token.</li>
<li> Now that the center of the Boston Planet is accessible, go there and collect the Hyperdrive. The planet also contains the final blue token, but it's not necessary to get to the Hyperdrive.</li></ol>

<p>The planet is tiny, grassy, and has few trees. Beret Guy is saying "Wow!", but since he's on the other side of the planet, it looks like he is shouting "Mom!".

<p>The planet has mostly been copied from <a href="/wiki/index.php/1110:_Click_and_Drag" title="1110: Click and Drag">1110: Click and Drag</a> and modelled to form a round planet, so the drawings are very tiny. The large rocket has been changed from the original look, possibly as a reference to SpaceX. Originally, it had no gravity, and the spaceship was only attracted by the gravity of the Crystal Sphere. This made navigating around the planet difficult, so a later update added gravity to it to make it easier for players to explore it.

<p>The planet is the Boston subway system that was ripped out from the Subway Planet by the MIT kids. The Hyperdrive, needed to explore the planets outside the Crystal Sphere, is at the center of the planet, which is only accessible after getting the green, red and orange subway tokens. The blue token is not strictly necessary to get the Hyperdrive, although it is the easiest to obtain. If the player goes to the location of the Boston Planet before turning off the MIT Cloaking Device, they will only find an invisible region out in space that has gravity, at the center of which a "strangely heavy subway token" can be found. The gravitational force around it remains even after the token is collected. As hinted by Blondie on Andal, the MIT Cloaking Device doesn't affect gravity, therefore the cloaked Boston planet is intangible and invisible, but its mass still affects the gravitational field around it.

<dl><dd>[What is shown on xkcd it what is known as the Starting planet. It is a small planet. On top of it is a small spaceship standing on two legs. It has a circular shape on top of the legs with a round window. Next to it is a small tree which is higher than the spaceship. This is the spaceship to be controlled by the user. The planet has grass all around, and the entire planet is visible. But the ship is in the center, so most of the planet is in the lover part of the panel. The background around the planet is a star-studded black backdrop. Going around the planet to clockwise from the small tree, there are two more trees with some small bushes between the first small tree and the two next trees. A larger tree is on the opposite part of the planet. Between the two trees and this there is a small bush and the Beret Guy who looks and point up from his point of view (down as seen in the image as he is on the opposite side). He is exclaiming a word. After the largest tree next to him, come a small tree. Before that Cueball and Megan stand together. On the last part back to the spaceship there is another small bush. There are also four gray dots. One above the spaceship. One between the first three and the two. One above the largest of the two trees together. And the final near the bush to the left of the spaceship. Those four dots are part of the game and can be removed if the ship touches them. In the bottom right corner of the panel there is a small white square with a black house drawn upon it. There are two small black dots beneath it. A curved arrow goes below the house from the right to the left dot. This is the home button that will always take the player back to this starting window. To the very right of the panel on height with the spaceship there is a white bar about three times the height of the spaceship. This bar indicates how much energy the spaceship has. It always refuels immediately after landing anywhere.]</dd>
<dd>Beret Guy: Wow!</dd>
<dd>[As Beret Guy is upside down, so is his words. They can thus easily be read as MOM as they are written, as always, in all caps.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[As part of the game there are messages appearing the first time you enter the comic, and every time you return to home of to the comic from another comic. Although they are not part of the image, they do appear on the home image. These messages appear as black text in a rectangular white panel with a black border. The messages are only on screen for a short time. On a mobile phone browser "Use the arrow keys" is "Tap the sides of your screen". The three situations follow here:]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[First time opening the game in a new browser there are two messages one appearing after the other:]</dd>
<dd>Greetings!</dd>
<dd>Use the arrow keys, pilot.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[When pressing the home button only one message appears:]</dd>
<dd>Welcome back, pilot.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[When reloading or going to the page after having been in another page or having shut down the program and opening again, there will be two messages:]</dd>
<dd>Welcome back! We saved your progress.</dd>
<dd>Use the arrow keys, pilot.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[When moving past the grey dots text is revealed in a similar manner to the greetings text. If it is items, then they are collected and listed beneath the panel under the heading "You've found:" A bulleted list will then start to grow beneath this as you play the game and collect items.]</dd></dl>

<p>"A special feature it that it does not have its own gravity, so the ship continues to be attracted to the crystal sphere regardless of which side of the planet you're on." This seems wrong. You are attracted to the Click and Drag planet and can land on it on any side. It is just that the gravity of the crystal sphere is so relatively huge that it quickly overpowers the gravity of the planet when too high above the surface on the near side makes the ground appear sloped on the "sides", similar to the moon of Origin. It would be really cool if someone could make a map that showed the gravity field everywhere. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.203.39" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.203.39">162.158.203.39</a> 11:09, 25 April 2023 (UTC)

</p><p>There is a way to escape the crystal dome.  Fly to the edge and continue around until you find the crack.

<p>There is an area that is a huge maze with cities marked on it -the subway system. In Washington DC there is a black hole, which even with lots of power ups I think is inescapable once you land on it (you can reset and retain your powerups). The map of the subway system is from xkcd 1196.
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm pretty sure the area is Boston. Also, the black hole just has very high, not infinite, gravity. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Purah126" title="User:Purah126">Purah126</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Purah126&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Purah126 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:27, 20 April 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Re:"there is a way out" - I went farther down and launched upwards as quickly as I could while not hitting the sides to get past the intense gravity. You can get to the top on the left side, but the gravity is so strong that you're basically stuck to the ground. If you scoot along farther to the left you see a spot that says "the end". Just past there, there is a small dip that, due to how strong the gravity is, I couldn't get out of. I wouldn't be surprised if you got enough upgrades you could get past it.
</p>
<dl><dd> If you go right instead, you can go all the way around the "crystal dome" and there is a point of interest a long the way (half way around maybe?) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.154.214" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.154.214">172.71.154.214</a> 19:34, 20 April 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>Once you get off the planet by falling through the tunnel and shooting out the other side you can fly around space, visiting other planets.  There are power ups in the form of balls with stars in the center.  Each power up gives your ship more thrust, faster recharge, etc.  If you keep flying straight eventually you get to a white barrier that goes all around space.  This is the crystal dome that is mentioned on the "origin" planet.  If you fly along the dome long enough you will eventually come across a crack in it.  As you fly up through the crack the gravity gets stronger and stronger.  Eventually you will not be able to any further.  You have to get enough power ups to fly out.  Once out there is a dome of text that just says "The end."  --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Silverfunk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Silverfunk (page does not exist)">Silverfunk</a> 18:52, 20 April 2023 (UTC)

<p>apparently if you exit the page it saves your "you've found:" stuff and your position, and a spoilery upgrade that shows a gray line, but not any of the upgrades you got to your ship.

</p><p>^this is a major buzzkill.  The page crashed on me twice, and both times I lost my upgrades.  It's essentially non-functional now.
</p><p>you can probably hack back the upgrades quickly somehow. for me, i found a handy variable to use for 'accessibility' (if you want to cheat/skip parts) is to set the starting position to that of some other location, for example to skip to 'mtba' (the +1000s are just so you're not warped to the center of the object, you'll need to tweak for other locations):
</p>
<pre> window.Comic.voyager.opts.startPos = [window.Comic.map.locations[61].pos[0]+1000, window.Comic.map.locations[61].pos[1] + 1000]
</pre>
<p>to reset to the original starting location:
</p>
<pre> window.Comic.voyager.opts.startPos = window.Comic.map.player.pos
</pre>
<p>in firefox anyway, you can use this to browse the game objects to poke around more:
</p>
<pre> console.dir(window.Comic)
</pre>
<p>in particular, .voyager and .map.locations are interesting, as is .gamestate.

<p>If you get stuck with your engine in a weird mode like warp or infinite improbability drive you can fix it by using the command ship.engines = “lander” and the ship gets set back to normal. I don’t think it keeps any upgrades though.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yeah, when slamming into a surface with high enough speed (possible even without hyperdrive, but very easy with), the ship seems to clip through the ground. It's possible then to navigate (very slowly) through the solid mass, which makes it even possible to leave the crystal sphere without hyperdrive (you are, however, stuck very close to the ground outside).

The absolute best I can get out of this page (across multiple browsers and platforms) is on my Android versions of Chrome and Firefox. It forces itself into full-screen mode and then by using touch regions at either side of the scene I can get one/both "turning thruster" plus the main-thruster to show a 'flame'. I can get it to turn, both ways, very very slowly but I seem to have no forward-thrust ability at all. I can be parallel to the ground and the side thrust from pressing both sides doesn't move me sideways any noticable amount (nor will a turning craft "roll" away from the palm-tree), free of gravitational resistance in that direction. If I stay facing upwards (or return to it) I just settle down under the weak (but stronger than any thrust!) gravity, spawn landing-gear and I no longer can even induce a rotation now being perched on legs. This is consistent in both browsers, so I rule out javascript-running inconsistencies in any obvious way.
<br />I presume (from reading the above) that I can get better thrusting, but whether by collecting things that I can't reach or by 'cheating' (more awkward, on mobile browsers, to edit page-variables/etc), I can't help thinking that it's already going wrong for me in ways it isn't for everyone else. And none of my desktop browsers even play ball for me at all (all I have is star background and the reset-button).
<br />On mobile browsers I've got a short thin line on the right-hand edge of the (fullscreen) background that I thought might be some sort of draggable power-bar (at 50% position, perhaps), but it doesn't respond to touch/dragging, or change at all. Might be just a relic of being on a wider-than-expected aspect ratio screen. Or it's something jutting (barely) on-screen from another nearby on-screen object/destination. As the viewpoint never moves, it's hard to say either way.
<br />This <i>is</i> more functionality than I ever got with Gravity, so maybe I'm just unluckily using incompatible browsers/platforms. A pity, though, that this is where I'm left with this. It looks like everyone else (or many, at least) are getting a lot out of this (and that), just not me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.79.137" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.79.137">172.69.79.137</a> 21:41, 21 April 2023 (UTC)

</p><p>Two things: First, you don't need the warpdrive to be able to exit the crystal sphere or to even explore the area outside of it like the cruiser ship. It's enough to have most of the other upgrades from inside the sphere and do some careful flying/orbital mechanicsing. Second with the warpdrive and most other upgrades you can escape from the black hole in the air and space museum. You likely can escape without the warp drive as well with some very careful flying but it's quite tricky to time the thrusters correctly to get a nice elliptical orbit going. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.59.64" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.59.64">172.69.59.64</a> 18:47, 22 April 2023 (UTC)
</p><p>Given the occasional occurrences of D&amp;D as a topic in xkcd and the recent re-publication of the Spelljammer setting for fifth edition D&amp;D, the Crystal Sphere might be a reference to Spelljammer (which likely drew on the already-mentioned story <i>The Crystal Spheres</i> by David Brin for the idea since Spelljammer was published 5 years after the short story). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.68.204" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.68.204">141.101.68.204</a> 22:57, 25 April 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Article structure and explaining </dt></dl>
<p>I have the impression, that the article structure is a bit messy, and I like to make some suggestions to improve it. Currently, the article is structured with a section for each planets. I suggest to keep that structure roughly but create several list below each of those sections 
</p><p>1. First I suggest to rename the "List of planets" to "List of planets and space objects".
</p><p>2. Second, I'd like to point out, there are several things to collect, which you can categorize clearly as following:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>"You've found"-items</b>: They appear as a collectible dot. When collected, there is a message of the style "You found WHATEVER". And that WHATEVER item gets added to the list "You've found:" below the comic.</li>
<li> <b>Upgrades</b>: They appear as large circle with a star. </li>
<li> <b>Messages</b>: They only display a message when you reach a certain spot. I think it is not visible that there is a message, before you reach that spot.</li>
<li> <b>Subway puzzle tokens.</b> They appear as dot with a "T" letter in it and unlock passages at the second subway planet.</li></ul>
<p>Basically you can get a good overview about those at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aeromancer.dev/xkcd_2765/map.html">https://aeromancer.dev/xkcd_2765/map.html</a> if you turn on those 4 things in the layer menu in the upper right corner. Beside from that you might also discover:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Fixed text messages.</b> From xkcd characters or on signs. You could also add the subway station names. </li>
<li> <b>Interesting looking objects</b>. This is a bit vague, as it is not clear, what to add there.</li></ul>
<p>However, those are completely passive things which do not interact with the space ship of the player.
</p><p>I think we should describe those four types of collectibles in the explanation section.
</p><p>3.  Currently, the lists at the planets do not separate the categories which I mentioned at 2. or only separate <b>Messages</b> from other collectibles. Sometimes it seems to me some of the passive objects or messages went into the list, too.
So I suggest to always separate the these six categories and add at least the first four of those to each planet and space object, unless the list is empty. For <b>Fixed text messages</b> I am not sure, if it is worth to always list them, but it is a clearly defined group. For the <b>Interesting looking objects</b> I would not make a list because it is not clear what to add or not. Instead I suggest to always describe them in the description text for the planet/space object.
</p><p>4. Note, that players get that "You've found:" list below the comic. Many would like to find out, if their list is complete and whether they have found everything. Currently with the list in that article this is not possible at all. Therefore, I think it is important, that the lists for the "You've found" matches exactly the list which appears below the game.
</p><p>5. Explain xkcd is about explaining. Many of the <b>You've found</b>, <b>Upgrades</b>, and <b>Messages</b> are (more or less funny) jokes or references to real things and/or other xkcd comics. We should explain them very shortly for each. So, behind each <b>You've found</b>, <b>Upgrades</b>, and <b>Messages</b> I suggest to put a very short explanation. You can separate this with a hyphen, a line break, start with italique font or do some other optical separation.
</p><p>6. Another option would be to create a huge sortable table with four columns:
</p>
<ul><li> Planet / Space Object</li>
<li> Type ('<i>You've found<b>, </b></i><b>Message</b>, <b>Upgrade</b>, <b>Subway token</b>, <b>fixed text message</b>)</li>
<li> Text (1 to 1 as in the game)</li>
<li> Explanation for the joke or reference.</li></ul>
<p>However, I am currently a bit more in favor for the planet/space object sections and just going with list. 
</p><p>What do you think about those 6 suggestions? Are you with me? Should we start with this restructuring? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.246.39" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.246.39">172.70.246.39</a> 12:53, 22 April 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I think it is good suggestions. Although text on the image should also be added to the full transcript. But yes in principle all references and jokes should be explained. But it is a huge project. I have also been taking some screenshots that I would like to add for reference but again it is such a huge and tedious job to upload them all. I think there should be a table of all the collectible items that would be nice to have with sortable so you can check alphabetically but also with planet/place so you can sort on that. Maybe no explanation there, but go to planet sections for that? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 10:20, 25 April 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hi, I have just finished the (hopefully) full transcript of the objects inside and on the outer edge of the Crystal Sphere. I have transcribed all the dialogues, monologues, signs and inscriptions. As for the messages of "You found" kind, I have copied them from the spreadsheet, just to be sure. Screenshotting is uncomfortable and my memory is short, so I have made a lot of mistakes until I noticed the spreadsheet. However, I have not put in the (shortened) object names as they appear on the "you've found" list. I think it may be a good start to take all the texts from there and put them in a table, so people can start writing explanations for everything. I will try to transcribe the rest (the big ships and the Click and Drag planet), but I am a bit tired of it already, maybe someone would take over. It's almost midnight here, have a good sleep everybody! --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Malgond" title="User:Malgond">Malgond</a>, late April 26th.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Outside the shell I found a powerup called "it is very lonely out here". I forget what kind of powerup it was...I had left the star destroyer and orbited counter-clockwise around the shell for several seconds before I saw it by chance, and after a bit of searching I was able to backtrack and pick it up. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.127.133" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.127.133">172.70.127.133</a> 00:04, 23 April 2023 (UTC)Nathan

<dl><dt>Glitches?</dt></dl>
<p>Anybody else got duplicate items? After picking up "very lonely out here", I fell into the crystal sphere hard enough to glitch and get stuck, so warped back home… and then noticed that the orb wren seemed to have respawned. Looking down the list (with the help of ctrl+F), I see that it does indeed appear twice in the list of objects I've found. No idea what happened there. I then went back to the outside and eventually managed to find the last item (the one talking about the "source"), but as soon as I touched it the ship became stationary. The messages appeared, but the item didn't vanish, and the controls were unresponsive. Refreshing the page left me in deep space, so I resorted to using the wayfinder script to find the dot again; and it confirmed that I'd collected everything.
</p><p>Is there something I've missed, or are these both weird little glitches? -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Angel" title="User:Angel">Angel</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Angel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Angel (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:57, 24 April 2023 (UTC)

</p><p>I can't say this happens on every planet, but on a few I've tried (What-If planet, small starting planet) if you are landed (no shields on) you can reverse thrust into the ground and dig into the planet.  In most cases there is nothing to find, but the "What-If Planet" has a Megan and Cueball floating around the open core.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.126.141" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.126.141">172.70.126.141</a> 21:23, 28 April 2023 (UTC)mlganser3

<dl><dt>Click and Drag Planet Trivia</dt></dl>
<p>Didn't know where to put this, so I made a new category: The Water tower on the click and drag planet is placed on the location with the highest gravity potential (which makes sense, of course!) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.114.88" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.114.88">172.70.114.88</a> 21:13, 24 April 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dt>What-If Planet Core</dt></dl>
<p>Once the hyperdrive has been obtained it is possible to travel to the centre of the What-If planet by parking on top of the volcano, accelerating forwards for a couple of seconds, stopping, then powering in reverse. Keeping reverse held down down for a very long time once in reverse, it will gradually travel to the centre of the planet where you meet Megan and Cueball. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.90.101" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.90.101">172.70.90.101</a> 17:00, 25 April 2023 (UTC)
</p><p>If you keep going in reverse past Megan and Cueball, eventually you pop out on the opposite side of the planet, just on the other side of a short pillar from where another Megan is sitting.  (Megan sits on a block looking at a short pillar.  On the other side of this pillar is where you emerge if entering from the volcano.)  You can also enter here by landing then powering in reverse.  Also, I was able to enter here in forward thrust, going quite fast (lucky shot, maybe?) but I got all the way into the center of the planet in very short order. 
</p><p>I've found that I can reverse thrust from any standing location and dig into any planet, not just the What-If Planet.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.127.134" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.127.134">172.70.127.134</a> 21:13, 28 April 2023 (UTC) mlganser3
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yeah, there seems to be a corridor of sorts through the What-If planet centre, between the volcano and the pillar that Megan is contemplating. Since it takes soooo long to go down the volcano, I definitely recommend starting at the pillar and reversing in. If you land on the pillar itself and reverse, it should get you to the centre space relatively quickly.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.123.148" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.123.148">172.71.123.148</a> 10:47, 5 May 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Inital Statrting Bug</dt></dl>
<p>I have a bug in my game where when I start, I am pushed off of the starting planet, and I continue to get pushed around. My shield is up and everything, and sometimes it tries to land. I have tried many of the cheats, but they aren't working. I need some help! AlabroX201 - 13:22, 26 April 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Making a table to organize EVERYTHING</dt></dl>
<p>Good heavens, y'all - format table so text is at the top of the cell.
</p><p>I'm currently making a table to organize planet (file)names, coordinates, and explanations, and the four item types and their explanation, inspired by the comments from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde">Kynde</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/User:Malgond">Malgond</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.246.39">172.70.246.39</a>. Here's my progress so far, do you have any suggestions or feedback? A few things to note:
</p>
<ul><li> I will try to add all explanations for each item found</li>
<li> The "???" are there because the spreadsheet with all the items doesn't include the message shown to the user. I temporarily put the words that the wiki used instead</li>
<li> All the "Z" between items will be replaced by a new line. The editor I'm using doesn't support adding new lines directly</li>
<li> Can someone let me know how to find the coordinates of each planet? Many thanks</li></ul>

<dl><dd>There's a bit of a mix in the game itself between messages, "You found" items and powerups. At first it looked like a small grey dot is an item, a bigger grey star is a powerup. Sometimes they're collocated, i.e. a dot inside the hollow center of a star. But further in the game, I have found hollow stars (i.e. without the dot inside) which leave a "you found" list item anyway. Also, sometimes the "you found" message contains a description that differs from the name on the list below the game viewport. The ultimate source of all is the spreadsheet linked at the start of <a href="/wiki/index.php/2765:_Escape_Speed#List_of_planets" title="2765: Escape Speed">List of planets</a> section. Any Message (including "you found..." messages) can be accompanied by an Item and an Action (an upgrade or some other things like decloaking or subway token), both of them or none of them.

<dd>Another comment: the Explanation column is currently a short description (of a planet) and some of its features, the way to get there, only sometimes containing an explanation of what the planet name refers to. These should be separate. Explanation shall be a short paragraph about a pun or reference connected to the name of a planet or the text found in the game. For example, explanation for the Message/Item of "11 squares packed into a larger square" shall have a reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/2740:_Square_Packing" title="2740: Square Packing">2740:_Square_Packing</a> and a short description of the mathematical problem involved. I also think we may need separate tables for planets (with very general descriptions and directions), features on the planets, possibly one table per planet (containing architecture, vegetation, animals, people etc. - if worth noting or there's some pun or reference), items and messages to be collected by the player (maybe one per planet), and for words spoken by the people and messages written somewhere (again, only if they contain a pun or a reference).

I'm not a fan of the new table.  It's harder to use 'cause long text is limited to narrow column.  How to get to where you're going needs to be its own column if we're doing this.  And I used the old list to organized to order I wanted to do things in.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.154.19" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.154.19">162.158.154.19</a> 20:08, 1 May 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Hey, I'm not sure when you made the comment, but yesterday <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> noticed that an item message was one extremely long word (something like "GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!") and added a space that made the table look much better. I think it's readable enough, and it's way more organized that the old list (and i added more info that wasn't there).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> &gt;How to get to where you're going needs to be its own column if we're doing this</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> If you add another column it's gonna get even more narrow, I think it's best to keep it as is. One could argue the instructions to get there are part of the explanation for the planet. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:FaviFake" title="User:FaviFake">FaviFake</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:FaviFake" title="User talk:FaviFake">talk</a>) 15:15, 2 May 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think it's important to keep the flow of conversation, so I'm putting this after what I'm replying to.  I hope that's not too confusing.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>&gt;It's way more organized that the old list (and i added more info that wasn't there).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, but in this particular instance, I think there are better ways of doing it.  You can set a template up where every planet is dealt with typographically in exactly the same way.  Each piece of information is in the same place relative to other pieces and handled typographically the same way in every single planet, the objects in interplanetay space and the objects in extraspherical space.  You'd loose the ability of a table to sort by arbitrary columns which doesn't seem to be a help with this information, but you'd also loose the annoying short lines, the fact that for most entries, the column head way up there above the readable portion of the screen and because you can use typography to show what different data is, it's a little more intuitive to us monkey-brained folk.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> For example <b>Planet-name: Large, Bold.</b> Colon, name in code, comma, coordinates as x=number and y=numers, all in regular wight roman.  <i>New line, Explanation of how to get there starting with "To get there" and in italics</i>.  New line, any other notes in roman.  New line, a bullet-pointed list of items and messages to find.  Each entry is structured Name of object or message when found in roman, powerup text in prethases, And then any notes in italics.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>Andal</b>: Filename: Andal, x= 123456 y= -654321</dd>
<dd><i>To get here, launch from below Saturn's equator, when the soccer ball is oriented to the bottom left compared to the rocket, or from the miniature of Andal to the left of the pyramids on Origin.</i></dd>
<dd>The planet is small and has a T-shaped tower, mountains, and grass. On a grass patch Blondie says to Cueball "The MIT cloaking device only affects the electroweak and nuclear forces. Gravity is the odd one out, as usual.", hinting that 'A random point out in space' is the Subway Planet.
<ul><li> You found two Andalites, one canonical! (Your thrusters are more efficient now.)</li>
<li> What a nice place for a ship to sit! (Your tanks recharge a bit faster now.)</li>
<li> You found a friend (Your thrusters are more efficient now.)</li>
<li> You found baby shoes (and baby)! (Engine power???)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>This can be tweeked and I don't program  in html ever so this can be improved.  And I recognize that this is harder than a table, but it is much better.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> I don't really agree this is better, the main reason we wanted to create the table in the first place was so that people could sort it at their liking: <i>"there should be a table of all the collectible items that would be nice to have with sortable so you can check alphabetically but also with planet/place so you can sort on that"</i>. Imagine someone wanted to obtain as many upgrades as possible: they would just sort the table to put the upgrades first and discard planets without them, or sort by subway tokens, to get the hyperdrive and know exactly where to look. A table is the only way to have that, and it's also more compact than a list. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:FaviFake" title="User:FaviFake">FaviFake</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:FaviFake" title="User talk:FaviFake">talk</a>) 14:28, 6 May 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>My game restarted after I hadn't played it in a while, but now there seems to be items missing?

<dl><dd>Hey, I've said this in my user page and I'll add it here too. I think the structure of the current table in the article is better at a few things than the one you've been working on: for example, it's easier to sort for upgrades and items (which was the main reason <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> wanted to make a sortable table in the first place), is more compact, and is easier to browse. Why don't we just add a "transcript" column like the table on <a href="/wiki/index.php/2712:_Gravity" title="2712: Gravity">2712: Gravity</a> to put what things and people say, and add the rest of the information on the respective columns on the current table?

<dl><dd>Also, we're already trying to move on from the old list and transfer everything to the "new" table. If we add a "newer" table, won't it become even harder to keep track of what needs to be moved and added to what? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:FaviFake" title="User:FaviFake">FaviFake</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:FaviFake" title="User talk:FaviFake">talk</a>) 15:39, 14 May 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Here's what I think we should do: we keep the compact, easy-to-use and easily sortable table in the article, but we put a notice above it that links to the /Tables page for people who want an even more in-depth look description and explanation of everything. The /Tables page is longer than the entire article page AND discussion page combined, so I think it would be too big to be added directly into the article. Do you guys like the plan?</dd>
