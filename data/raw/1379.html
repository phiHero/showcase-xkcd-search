<p>This comic represents the impacts due to climate change by demonstrating the changes in climate that should be expected with a given change in global temperature. This is done by detailing the world's climate in geologic periods where the global average temperature has changed by one or more "Ice Age Units," or IAU. The comic defines an IAU as the difference in global temperature between today and the last ice age, about 4.5&#160;°C. An IAU of 0 represents modern global temperature.  It was later followed with a similar but much more elaborate chart in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1732:_Earth_Temperature_Timeline" title="1732: Earth Temperature Timeline">1732: Earth Temperature Timeline</a>.
</p><p>One IAU unit happens to be the expected increase in global temperature the world will see by the end of year 2100. The prediction of 4-5 degrees Celsius of warming may not appear significant, but is easy to see as a substantial difference when comparing today to the last ice age. 
</p>
<dl><dd> An IAU of -4 is associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Snowball Earth">Snowball Earth</a>. Snowball earth is a near-total freezing of the entire surface around 650 million years ago, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenian" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cryogenian">Cryogenian</a>. This may have been the greatest ice age known to have occurred on Earth.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> An IAU of -1 is associated with the last ice age. During this time <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall's</a> neighborhood was buried under an ice sheet.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> An IAU of +1 is the predicted global temperature by the end of year 2100. While it makes sense to assume it's just as drastic a difference as -1 IAU, we still don't know the actual nature of what it would be, which is why it is represented by a question mark in the comic.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> An IAU of +2 is associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous_Thermal_Maximum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cretaceous Thermal Maximum">"Hothouse Earth"</a> of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous_period" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cretaceous period">Cretaceous period</a>. At this time there were "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arecaceae">palm trees</a> at the poles" as there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_forests_of_the_Cretaceous" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Polar forests of the Cretaceous">polar forests</a> during Cretaceous summers. (Average temperature of North Pole during the summer is 0&#160;°C or 32&#160;°F. 0+2*4.5 = 9&#160;°C = 48.2&#160;°F, hot enough for trees to grow at the North Pole under hypothetical 2 IAU scenarios)</dd></dl>
<p>An increase of 4.5&#160;°C (+1 IAU) seems like a small change in temperature, but the changes it would cause are likely very large as it can also be described as halfway to palm trees at the poles.
</p><p>The topic of ice coverage over various cities has previously been covered in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1225:_Ice_Sheets" title="1225: Ice Sheets">1225: Ice Sheets</a>. The image of Boston from that comic is reused at the top of the huge chart in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1732:_Earth_Temperature_Timeline" title="1732: Earth Temperature Timeline">1732: Earth Temperature Timeline</a>.
</p><p>This comic shows the extreme extent to which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Global warming">global warming</a> can (and will) change our environment. Randall presented this view earlier in <a href="/wiki/index.php/164:_Playing_Devil%27s_Advocate_to_Win" title="164: Playing Devil&#39;s Advocate to Win">164: Playing Devil's Advocate to Win</a>. Climate change, especially global warming, is a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Climate_change" title="Category:Climate change">recurring theme</a> in xkcd. This is because many still believe the <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/conspiracy_theory"><span style="background: #eef;" title="RationalWiki page">conspiracy theory</span></a></span> that <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/global_warming"><span style="background: #eef;" title="RationalWiki page">global warming</span></a></span> is a hoax.
</p><p>The title text expands, demonstrating that  the potential impacts of an increase by the IPCC report's best case scenario of 2&#160;°C, about half an ice age unit, makes controlling climate change seem more urgent. The figure of 2&#160;°C is the most commonly agreed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation#Temperature_targets" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Climate change mitigation">temperature target</a> that assumes the creation of aggressive emissions limits at the time of the publishing of the comic.

<p>The 4.5 degree increase is predicted by the bern2.5cc simulation (a moderate simulation) of the A1FI scenario. In the A1FI scenario the world has a high dependence on fossil  fuels, experiences "very rapid economic growth", a declining world population by 2050, as well as a high rate of increase in energy efficiency after 2050.

<p>The oldest known animal fossils (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges#Fossil_record" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sponges">sponges</a>) are from the Snowball Earth, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant#Evolution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Flowering plant">flowering plants</a> became the dominant plant species during the Cretaceous period. It is believed that the entire Earth was frozen for the first time about 2,400 to 2,100 million years ago, which could have been a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Great Oxygenation Event">Great Oxygenation Event</a>.
</p><p>The 200m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Current sea level rise">sea level rise</a> given in the last panel for a "Cretaceous Hothouse" (i.e. if all ice on earth melted, including the Antarctic ice cap) could not be explained by this melt-off alone. If all the ice melted the water level would only increase by about 60-80m, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/">IPCC Third Assessment Report</a> (section 11.2.3 on Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://water.usgs.gov/edu/sealevel.html">Sea Level and Climate: USGS Water-Science School</a>. Additional sea level rise can be expected from thermal expansion of seawater, and indeed the main reason for rising sea level at the moment is actually caused by this expansion of the sea due to increasing temperature. But the high-end 500-year projection for a 4x increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise#IPCC_Third_Assessment" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Current sea level rise">expansion of the sea</a>, is for an additional 2m due to thermal expansion, with a decreasing rate of growth over time. (Some of the sea level change in the Cretaceous are due to changes in bathymetry.)
</p><p>The 5th and most recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC AR5) presents four alternative trajectories for future concentrations of greenhouse gasses, termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Representative Concentration Pathways">Representative Concentration Pathways</a> (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. They are named after possible ranges of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5&#160;W/m2, respectively). The hottest of these, RCP8.5, is predicted to result in a warming of 2.6&#160;°C to 4.8&#160;°C for the  2081−2100 period, and between 3 and 5.5 by the year 2100 (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.climate2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf">Working Group I Summary for Policymakers</a>). 
</p><p>The lack of internationally binding agreements makes breaching an increase of 2&#160;°C more and more likely.

</p><p>I imagine the Earth's axial tilt wouldn't change even if the temperature changed by +2 IAU. So, would palm trees survive the extreme day/night lengths at the poles? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/103.22.201.239" title="Special:Contributions/103.22.201.239">103.22.201.239</a> 05:31, 9 June 2014 (UTC) P.S. Also, wouldn't the North Pole be underwater, so incapable of supporting palm trees?
Also, regarding the IAU, is it a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:International Astronomical Union">IAU</a> that named an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4942_Munroe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:4942 Munroe">asteroid</a> after Randall?
</p><p>"While it says it's "probably no big deal," this is probably a joke, because even half of an Ice Age would be a lot of ice."  The article has it wrong.  It's a 2 degree increase, not decrease.

<dl><dd> While burning biomass adds CO2, the whole point of "burning a biologically-sourced fuel" like biodiesel is that you are merely returning to the atmosphere CO2 that was sucked out of the atmosphere by the biological material in the first place.  So you grow an acre of plant material, and that acre of plant material sucks a certain amount of CO2 out of the atmosphere.  When you then burn that plant material, you are releasing that CO2 back in to the atmosphere.  Thus it is a "net zero" operation.  While yes, it would be better to do a "net negative" operation (plant more plants while NOT releasing ANY CO2,) a net zero operation is still better than what we're doing now - releasing massive amounts of CO2 that have been locked up for geological-scale lengths of time, all in a VERY short timeframe.  If you were to replace all work-generation power sources with "net zero" sources like biodiesel production and biomass generation, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere would stop rising immediately.  (Well, once they have reached equilibrium from other sources, anyway.)  But of course, the difficulty is growing sufficient biological fuel material fast enough to create enough fuel for our needs.  (The famous "it would take more farmland than currently exists on all of planet Earth, all of it dedicated to growing corn, to grow enough corn to make enough corn-derived ethanol to fuel every vehicle on the planet" problem.)  So obviously energy efficiency and non-bio-fuel renewable energy methods are also needed.  But biofuel (burning biomass, ethanol, biodiesel, etc,) is still a SIGNIFICANT improvement over oil/natural gas/coal. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.245.216" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.245.216">108.162.245.216</a> 07:31, 20 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>60 meters is indeed the amount the sea would rise if all the glacial ice melted. However, that figure presumably does not take into account have much the sea would rise by expansion due to the increased heat. That is, after all, the main reason for rising sea levels today. So I would guess that the +200 figure is the 60 meters of added water from glacial ice <i>plus</i> the amount it would rise due to warming and expanding. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Calebxy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Calebxy (page does not exist)">Calebxy</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Calebxy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Calebxy (page does not exist)">talk</a>)
<dl><dd>While that's possible, and desalination of water can also cause it to expand (sea water is more dense than fresh), we shouldn't try to justify the numbers if they are incorrect.

In law, for example, we follow the cases that have been established in similar situations so that we can advise our clients on the <i>best</i> course (and by best, I mean the course that won't land you in court paying outrageous fees) of action. We don't have to experience it ourselves in order to reach the desired outcome. We can draw analogies from similar fact patterns.

THAT made Einstein famous. We don't really have the same kind of proof for AGW. We have lot of data which has been tampered with or cherry-picked, even the scientists can't be sure what to believe.

</p><p>There are several troubling things with this comic (including the sea level figure), but the most basic is the opening statement: "Without prompt, aggressive limits on CO2 emissions, the Earth will likely warm by an average of 4°-5°C by the century’s end." This is probably from the latest IPCC report, but it takes the worst of several proposed scenarios, and claims it to be the likely one. RCP8.5 projects 2.6C-4.8C, and I suppose that's what getting averaged *up* to "4.5C" for the temperature line in the comic. The second most troubling thing is that mouse-over text, regarding the 2C lid if we "enact aggressive emissions limits now"—this is an entirely arbitrary (unscientific) number based on largely unspecified changes to what the world is doing now.

<dd>1600-1700 years ago there were 6+ billion fewer people (a large proportion with dwellings near shorelines, or economically dependant on them somehow) on the planet! <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.237" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.237">108.162.250.237</a> 11:38, 15 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>According to the Scientific Forecasts from 1986, this should have had already happened by the year 2000: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/movies/earth-s-climatic-crisis-examined-by-nova.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/movies/earth-s-climatic-crisis-examined-by-nova.html</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.217" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.217">108.162.246.217</a> 01:18, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That link is basically a TV Guide listing for a rerun of a NOVA program which was filmed in 1983. The listing was written by a movie critic who presumably watched the program but may not have quoted it correctly. Anyway, that's popular media, not real science. If you want real science, look at peer-reviewed scientific journals. In the 30+ years since that program was filmed, we have gathered a LOT more data. It's not surprising that our understanding of what's going on is more complete now than it was in 1983. That's how science works. The more data you gather, the more accurate your predictions become (hence older predictions were generally less accurate).<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.128.232" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.128.232">199.27.128.232</a> 18:53, 23 February 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Since I used to live next to Burgh Castle, can I point out that the castle is indeed now c6m higher than the current estuary level. The nearby town of Great Yarmouth is built on land that first appeared above the waves around 1100AD. In Roman times it was possible to sail from Burgh Castle to the castle at Caistor - that's why they were built, to defend the mouth of the estuary between them.If you look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Acle,+Norwich,+Norfolk+NR13/@52.6213598,1.6099949,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d9ff1ac61e4df5:0x957c4241ca1f0de3">map</a> very roughly all the green was under water circa 300AD --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.251" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.251">141.101.98.251</a> 19:04, 1 November 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>All the angry people who like to shout "AGW has been debunked! The models aren't exact! I have a fantasy that because I'm the smartest person in the world I will be rich by 30 and therefore I hate anything related to taxes! I've been trained to growl at liberals!" What do they want to do? Even if they're right that the changes would have happened even without humanity and that the effects will be more chaotic and less straightforward and that the 25-year projection will really take 45 years and so on... Does that mean we should just gleefully accept all the changes? I realize that San Francisco; New York, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Stockholm all being underwater sounds like fun to a right-wing partisan--no more hippies, no more "liberal media", no more UN and EU, no more wildly successfully social democracies that disprove all of their economic theories, etc.--don't they care that most of the world's financial and knowledge industries, every conservative think-tank, and most of Rupert Murdoch's houses will also be gone? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.52" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.52">162.158.255.52</a> 22:01, 24 September 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>"Sea level was higher during most of the Cretaceous than at any other time in Earth history, and it was a major factor influencing the paleogeography of the period. In general, world oceans were about 100 to 200 metres (330 to 660 feet) higher in the Early Cretaceous and roughly 200 to 250 metres (660 to 820 feet) higher in the Late Cretaceous than at present. The high Cretaceous sea level is thought to have been primarily the result of water in the ocean basins being displaced by the enlargement of midoceanic ridges." <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Cretaceous-Period">https://www.britannica.com/science/Cretaceous-Period</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jubal_Harshaw&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jubal Harshaw (page does not exist)">Jubal Harshaw</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jubal_Harshaw&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jubal Harshaw (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:35, 14 August 2016 (UTC)
