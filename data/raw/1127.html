<p>It appears that the (at the time) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States presidential election, 2012">upcoming 2012 election</a> has put <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> into a political state of mind, as this is the second comic in a few weeks that has dealt with political history (<a href="/wiki/index.php/1122:_Electoral_Precedent" title="1122: Electoral Precedent">1122: Electoral Precedent</a>). As with that comic, this comic goes through the entire history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Federal government of the United States">U.S. Federal Government</a>. Also notably, Randall makes a number of observations that are akin to the type of observations Randall denounces in 1122 (e.g. for 1928, Randall notes that no Republican has since won the presidency without a Nixon or a Bush on the ticket). Just around the election he posted two more comics related to this: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1130:_Poll_Watching" title="1130: Poll Watching">1130: Poll Watching</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1131:_Math" title="1131: Math">1131: Math</a>.

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Federal government of the United States">U.S. Federal Government</a>, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Separation of powers">checks and balances</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bicameralism">bicameral</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States Congress">United States Congress</a>, which consists of two "houses": the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States Senate">Senate</a>, its "upper" house; and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> ("the House"), its "lower house". The Senate consists of 2 senators elected from each state (thus 100 total), while the House consists of 435 voting representatives (a number decided upon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_Act_of_1911" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apportionment Act of 1911">1911</a> by law) whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States congressional apportionment">apportionment</a> is split between the states proportional to their population; although each state gets at least one (the House also has non-voting representatives from non-state territories like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a>). Every ten years, the House is reapportioned based on the latest census. The most populous state as of 2012 is California which has 53 seats in the House. Senators serve 6-year terms with elections held every 2 years for one-third of the seats. Members of the House (called Representatives or Congressmen/women) serve 2-year terms with all of the seats contested every 2 years.
</p><p>In order for a bill to become a law, it must be passed by both the House and the Senate. In a way, this theoretically ensures that the bill is supported both by the majority of states (the Senate), and the majority of the population (the House). The President may then sign the bill into law, he may "veto" the bill, or he may do nothing, in which case it becomes a law if and only if Congress is in session after a waiting period of 10 days (not including Sundays).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_ideologies">Political ideologies</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1127:_Congress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Political ideologies">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In politics, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Political spectrum">scale</a> that represents the political beliefs of a politician. The scale goes from "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Left-wing politics">left</a>" to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Right-wing politics">right</a>" of "center" — which generally describes a balancing point of beliefs (sometimes called "left-wing" or "right-wing").
</p><p>The "left" is a general belief in social justice, and is sometimes associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Socialism">socialism</a>. Modern left-wingers generally prioritize equality, and support policies like welfare and government-subsidized healthcare. This trends toward having a larger federal government. In the U.S., "liberal" is a term often used to denote left-leaning tendencies.
</p><p>The "right" generally believe in personal responsibility and individual liberty, which is often termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Conservatism">conservative</a>. This trends towards having less regulation and thereby a smaller federal government. The goal is to keep the nation stable, and reducing the interference by the government with a person's wealth. This ostensibly means lower taxes, because the government does not provide as much.
</p><p>Politicians typically align themselves into groups of similar beliefs and positions called "parties". In the U.S., there have generally been two dominant parties, although there have been times where three or more parties have shared roughly equal influence and support. In today's politics (which is apparently known as (the second part of) the fifth era of political parties, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Party_System" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fifth Party System">Fifth Party System</a>, as noted on the outside edges of the comic) of the two current primary U.S. political parties, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrats" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Democrats">Democrats</a> are the left-leaning party, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicans" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Republicans">Republicans</a> are the right-leaning party. The dominant parties are generally considered "moderate" in their left- or right-wing leanings, as either party appears to requires the support of a majority (or a few percent under) of voters to win. However, this is complicated by a process called gerrymandering where election boundaries are redrawn to allow a political advantage to the party currently in power. Thus a popular majority state wide or any ratio of votes to representatives will not necessarily be reflected in delegates awarded, an example being the Republicans' REDMAP 2012 report (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/21/16630863-virginia-republicans-move-for-permanent-majority">[1]</a>). Smaller parties often run candidates with more extreme views, but such candidates rarely win, due to a more limited number of possible supporters ensuring that even a relatively large minority would have zero chance of representation. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Duverger&#39;s law">Duverger's law</a>).

<p>The comic effectively consists of three separate charts: The left- and right-hand charts are the main charts; they represent the Senate and House respectively, and purport to show the left- and right-wing leanings of each legislature through U.S. history. There is a legend on the right that sets out fairly clearly how the charts work, but basically Randall has split each wing into three levels including the very moderate or "Center" right or left, and the more extreme or "Far" right or left, as well as the average left and right without prefix. A dotted yellow line represents the balance of power in each legislature, and white lines represent the leanings of certain notable people including presidents.
</p><p>Some presidents are not indicated, because they were never senators or congressmen (most of these were state Governors, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bill Clinton">Clinton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:George W. Bush">Bush</a> and 2012 candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</a>). As may be noted from the chart, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> is considered "left" while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Paul Ryan">Paul Ryan</a> is considered "far right". It's also notable that the "center right" ideology appears to be completely eradicated from the House and is waning in the Senate (although a similar trend is shown around 1900 with the centrists making a comeback thereafter).
</p><p>On either side of these charts, there are descriptions or explanations for expansions and contractions of each ideological group.
</p><p>The center chart appears to primarily act as a timeline. Each president is listed with their leanings indicated by a left or right arrow. Wars are shaded in grey. Other notable events are also indicated. On either side of the center chart (although somewhat mixed in with the aforementioned Senate/House explanations), there are also references to the primary parties of each era showing how they evolved (left-leaning parties on the left, and right-leaning parties on the right).
</p><p>Finally, there's a little extra commentary on the right side, below the legend.

<p>The title text refers to two political parties in American history: the Federalists and the Jacksonians.
</p><p>Note that this means the two parties are not strictly contemporaries. There are features of both the modern Republican and Democratic parties in each, so depending on the topic presented, it may take a long time to figure out that they are not these modern parties until the topic of discussion changes. They do, however, make a nice dichotomy. 
</p><p>The Federalists are one of the oldest political parties in American History. Federalists were seen as conservative in their time, and similarly to modern Republicans much of their support came from bankers and businessmen and they were committed to a fiscally sound and government, but on the flip side they favored a strong central government, regulation of industry, a national banking system, and were protectionistic.
</p><p>The Jacksonian party is one of the four branches of the Democratic Party that developed during the political chaos after the Federalist party died out in the War of 1812. The Jacksonians were considered liberal for their time, they believed in one man, one vote, regardless of standing, and their mascot was a donkey and they're the ancestors of the modern Democratic Party, but on the flip side they did not want a strong national government and believed that the government should have limited impact in the regulation of industry, going so far as to end the bank of the United States, and were fiercely expansionistic.
</p><p>Network news channels regularly feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pundit">talking heads</a>, supposed 'experts' who offer their opinion on the topical political stories. Where these talking heads are strongly aligned with a particular party, and are unconcerned with anything other than winning, they could be described as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Partisan">partisan</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_hack" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Political hack"> hacks</a>.

<dd><b>The United States Congress</b></dd>
<dd>Partisan and ideological makeup</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The comic is divided into three massive sections, SENATE, PRESIDENCIES, and HOUSE. Timelines run backwards down the page between each section. In the HOUSE and SENATE sections, shifting, curving red and blue areas of different brightness illustrate the shifting balance of power between "Members of Left-Leaning Parties" and "Members of Right-Leaning Parties". Under PRESIDENCIES, different administrations are labeled and wars are shaded in gray. There are notes throughout all sections.]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>LEGEND
<dl><dd><i>[Square containing ribbons of color merging upwards with larger areas]</i>: Branches join in when new members enter Congress and cause an ideological bloc to grow. (Note: If the new member is elected as another retires from the same ideological bloc, no change is shown.)</dd>
<dd><i>[Square containing ribbons of color splitting off from larger areas]</i>: Branches split off when members leave Congress, causing their ideological bloc to shrink. (Note: If the new member is elected as another retires from the same ideological bloc, no change is shown.)</dd>
<dd><i>[Square showing yellow dotted line crossing from red to blue area]</i>: The yellow line marks the midpoint, which indicates which side has control of the chamber.</dd>
<dd><i>[Square in which curve briefly separates from blue area]</i>: If a bloc loses members in one election and gains them in the next, the exiting stream may rejoin. This does not necessarily mean the same people returned.</dd>

<dl><dd>HOW IDEOLOGY IS CALCULATED
<dl><dd>Each member of Congress is assigned to an ideological category using DW-NOMINATE, a statistical system created by political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal. This system rates each member of Congress's ideological position position [sic] based on their votes.</dd>
<dd>DW-NOMINATE is purely mathematical and involves no judgement on the content of bills. Instead, members of Congress are placed on a spectrum based on how consistently they vote together.</dd>
<dd>While people argue that ideology is many-dimensional, Poole and Rosenthal found that nearly all Congressional voting behavior - especially in the modern era - can be accurately predicted by using just one ideological variable.</dd>
<dd>This variable turns out to roughly correspond to position on the classic economic liberal/conservative spectrum.</dd>
<dd>Because members of Congress have served in overlapping terms with past members in a chain back to the first Congress, the system allows comparison of ideology across time - even accounting for individual members' ideological drift. (Note: Scores are comparable across time but not between chambers.)</dd>

<dl><dt>Congress as check</dt></dl>
<p>Perhaps a pedantic point, but I couldn't leave the description describing Congress as simply a check on the president.  That would imply that the president has free reign (literally) and that Congress only acts (or, more often, doesn't act) to veto the president.  That is a much more accurate description of the president's role in legislation (or of a pre-modern English Parliament).  <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:208.32.120.10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:208.32.120.10 (page does not exist)">208.32.120.10</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:208.32.120.10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:208.32.120.10 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dt>definition of conservative is pejorative</dt></dl>
<p>Conservatives are not interested in preserving wealth amongst those who have it - they are interested in creating as many opportunities to create wealth as possible by reducing unwanted government regulation and returning to constitutional limitations (aka 10th ammendment) on Federal power.  A different view of liberty and rights than what liberals maintain, but highly supported - I find your definition to be highly pejorative. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ghaller825&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ghaller825 (page does not exist)">Ghaller825</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghaller825&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ghaller825 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:59, 29 October 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Perhaps the segment could be changed to say "conservatives believe the government should not interfere with a person's wealth", or something very similar. The resistence to government involvement seems to be more consistent across the various degrees of the modern conservative movement. I'll admit that my suggested statement is also false, because almost everyone believes there should be some amount of taxes, and taxes affect wealth. However, it should be more palatable to the political ideology.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I understand your offense, Ghaller. On the other hand, the current phrasing using "making wealth" is also a loaded term, as many factory workers would feel that they are "the ones who make it" more than the CEOs, but are certainly not getting more money. I'm not saying I agree with that perspective, just that it's a suggestive statement, and this is not the forum to have an endless debate over it.

</p><p>That comment makes it sound like there's some conspiracy behind the left thinking up good names for their movements. The words themselves don't really mean anything. You don't have to go back too far in US history to find 'liberals' and 'socialists' being demonized as spies and traitors, and even today the right is happy to call the left 'liberal' with strong undertones of 'weak'. Leftist are generally better at naming things I'll grant you, but then almost all leftist movements (barring the Khmer Rouge and cultural revolution era china) have had strong ties to both universities and the entertainment industry, people who are used to being persuasive with words so it's not surprising that they came up with nice friendly sounding terms for their movements.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:LostAlone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:LostAlone (page does not exist)">LostAlone</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:LostAlone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:LostAlone (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:17, 6 April 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Conservative?</dt></dl>
<p>He didn't exactly say that Conservatives are interested in preserving wealth amongst those who have it; I think the implication is that "if you made it, you should get to keep it" (or as much of it as possible, hence lower taxes). One <i>consequence</i> of this is that the <i>distribution</i> of wealth tends to remain static, in that the rich stay rich and the poor stay (relatively) poorer. Whether or not that consequence is an intentional one is perhaps in the eye of the pejoratively-inclined beholder&#160;:-)--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Joe_Green&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Joe Green (page does not exist)">Joe Green</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Joe_Green&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Joe Green (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:30, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Left vs right - or why this comic is stupid</dt></dl>
<p>The traditional definition of left vs right (people attribute all sorts of things to it these days) is the support of change (hence the names progressives vs conservatives, or radicals vs reactionaries). The terminology comes from France where those that advocated reforms to government sat on the left of the chamber and those that wanted to do such things as restore the monarchy sat on the right. Your traditional Burkian conservative (smidgen to the right of the centre) would accept change is inevitable, but must be controlled. To the right of that people that want to maintain the status quo, further right people that want to go back to some "better time". To the left you get the, let change happen as it comes, further left lets make change a "good thing", to the furthest left "lets force change". A large part of the Marxist philosophy is that not only is communism desirable, but inevitable as according to Marx that is the final destination of all societies. Now to my point. Over time the parties have switched sides and often will be left on one issue and right on another. Often the parties themselves were divided (look at the civil rights act's passage) To simply say Democratic Party has always been left and the Republicans have always been is such a gross simplification that is renders the whole image a farce. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/192.43.227.18" title="Special:Contributions/192.43.227.18">192.43.227.18</a> 01:07, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

</p><p>It might help to have a corollary chart that tracks gerrymandering, that is the practice of selecting and isolating minority and majority populations in districts so that there is virtually no contest at the time of election. A city can be carved up to include just enough suburban voters to overwhelm what would otherwise have been their political choice. Districts now often resemble convoluted, sinuous serpent creatures rather than geography divided along natural boudaries. If someone could write code that would redraw districts with the following parameters: number of voters, and walking distance to polling places - without regard to income, race, party designation, etc. It would change the map drastically.
At any rate, many districts have been redrawn to control election results. Such a chart would parallel the divisions in congress.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bralbovsky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bralbovsky (page does not exist)">Bralbovsky</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bralbovsky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Bralbovsky (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:25, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>Someone could (and probably has) come up with code to do what you suggest, but the courts won't let them use it.  
</p><p>When districts are drawn without regard to race, some racial groups wind up underrepresented, because they are a substantial percentage of the total population, but are not a majority in a proportional number of districts (for example, if there are 4 districts and they are 25% of the total populations, then they should be able to elect someone from that group in 1 district, but if they are 25% of each district, then members of the other racial group, which is 75% of each district, may get elected in all 4 districts, when it should be just 3).  This is considered unfair and a violation of their right to "equal protection", so districts must be drawn along racial lines to comply with court orders to give these groups fairer representation.

<dl><dd>This is actually a pretty recent thing--and a silly one. Traditionally, each news outlet picked colors independently, and they were pretty evenly split among red for Republican or red for Democrat most years. In 2000, when the election was hung waiting on the Florida recount, everyone on TV was pointing at electoral maps on every broadcast. After two days, NBC switched colors. Other outlets began to follow suit, and once most outlets were using the same color scheme, after which pundits started talking about "red states" and "blue states" as shorthand for states where republicans or democrats won, and we've been stuck with that ever since. So, what made NBC change? Either their news director was annoyed that NBC and the Washington Post (the first paper he read in the morning) used opposite colors, or one of their pundits couldn't remember which colors they used and suggested that the alliterative red=Republican would help him stop screwing it up. Whichever of those is true is the ultimate reason red means Republican. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.130.180" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.130.180">199.27.130.180</a> 12:24, 18 September 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
