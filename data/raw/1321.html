<p>In this comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> (wearing a white knit cap with a pom-pom) and Cueball's friend (wearing a black knit cap) are walking outside in sub 0&#160;°F (-17.8&#160;°C). White Knit Cap Guy complains about the <b>brutal</b> cold and as a result questions whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Global warming">global warming</a> is real. Black Knit Cap Guy explains that this kind of weather used to happen all the time back before the year 2000, showing that global warming is, in fact, very real.
</p><p>This is illustrated in panel two by a graph showing the number of days with sub 0&#160;°F as a function of year from 1970 to 2013 in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:St. Louis">St. Louis</a>, (where we learn that Cueball is from). It shows that these days used to be rather common between 1970 and 1999, only to be completely absent for the next 14 years until and including 2013. A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rcc-acis.org/climatecentral">source link</a> for this graph is provided (though as of June 2014, the link is dead - see <a href="#Trivia">Trivia</a> below).
</p><p>Cueball's friend uses this graph to explain that not a single day like this has happened since 2000, until here in 2014 where a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Polar vortex">polar vortex</a> pushed the temperature down below zero again for two days. Since this weather is now unusual and infrequently experienced, people in St. Louis perceive it as being very cold because they have since adapted and are now unused to this sort of temperature, even though this was a common temperature to reach in past decades. This is further demonstrated when Cueball remarks that it's "too cold". Subzero <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a> temperatures are very cold to be out in. See for instance the first panel of <a href="/wiki/index.php/526:_Converting_to_Metric" title="526: Converting to Metric">526: Converting to Metric</a>.
</p><p>In the last panel, in a future St. Louis, a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> discovers a thin sheet of ice, suggesting the temperature has fallen just below 32&#160;°F (0&#160;°C), the freezing point of water. The suggestion here is that the environment has warmed to such an extent that temperatures below 32&#160;degrees F are very unusual, and the future Cueball repeats the same short-term fallacy that such "extreme cold" disproves global warming. Someone off-panel, presumably another Black Knit Cap Guy, sighs as the cycle continues.
</p><p>The comic reacts to a simplified view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Global warming">global warming</a> by amateurs, including media, who fail to understand (or choose to ignore) the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Climate">climate</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Weather">weather</a>. Short, random weather fluctuations like the polar vortex are taken as examples or counter-examples of climate change and global warming. To understand climate change, one must look at global (not local) and long-term (not short-term) temperature trends.
</p><p>Debates on the theory of global warming/climate change often center on whether the current warming trend is primarily caused by humans or is a natural change, as has happened in the past. Within the scientific community, there is an overwhelming consensus that the current trend is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Human impact on the environment">anthropogenic</a> (i.e. man-made), but many in the general public (including many politicians) are hesitant to accept this. There is clearly no doubt about where <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> stands on this debate, as many of his comics and blog posts continue to plead for humanity to do something about the <i>man-made</i> global warming trend - especially in comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1379:_4.5_Degrees" title="1379: 4.5 Degrees">1379: 4.5 Degrees</a>.
</p><p>The title text suggests that gathering data about global warming is time-consuming and is the kind of stuff only a real nerd would do. Most people would rather hang out with friends, or at least spend their time with some more fun nerd activity. Randall has been known to use the title text to poke fun at himself over how much time he has spent researching topics and more generally how geeky his interests tend to be. Although the title text tries to deny this geeky behavior, he cannot help himself at the end by mentioning another <i>interesting</i> climate subject: <i>Snowfall records</i>.
</p><p>Climate change, especially global warming, is a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Climate_change" title="Category:Climate change">recurring theme</a> in xkcd.

<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://assets.climatecentral.org/pdfs/TVMFrigidNights2014_stlouis_med.jpg">The graph</a> can still be found in Climate Central's assets.

<li>From the graph the following info can be found:
<ul><li>During the 30 years before 2000 there were 89 days with subzero Fahrenheit temperatures, averaging almost three a year.</li>
<li>During that period there were only one occurrence where there were two years in a row with <b>no</b> subzero days. This was then followed by a gap of 14 years without.</li>
<li>The maximum was 13 subzero days in 1984, but no less than three years had more than 10 subzero days.</li>
<li>As these record years are all in the 8-year period from 1977 to 1984, no less than 52 of these 89 subzero days occurred in those years.</li>
<li>Here are the number of days from 1970 to 2000 as read of the graph:
<ul><li>1970 - 4; 1971 - 0; 1972 - 4; 1973 - 0; 1974 - 4; 1975 - 0; 1976 - 1; 1977 - 11; 1978 - 5; 1979 - 8; 1980 - 1; 1981 - 3; 1982 - 11; 1983 - 0; 1984 - 13; 1985 - 2; 1986 - 1; 1987 - 0; 1988 - 1; 1989 - 0; 1990 - 5; 1991 - 0; 1992 - 0; 1993 - 1; 1994 - 3; 1995 - 0; 1996 - 3; 1997 - 6; 1998 - 0; 1999 - 2; 2000 - 0;</li>
<li>Compared with the graph in the link above, there is one mistake in Randall's version, as there were two days not only one day in 1976 according to the on-line graph.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>While there were a number of very cold years with outliers in the 1970s - then the clear overall trend is still that there are fewer days with cold weather over the years.
</p><p>So while <b>weather is different every year</b> (which is also illustrated by the outliers) the <b>climate is defined by the long term trend</b> - which is the point of this cartoon.

I really hate when articles on science get a POV tag.  Science isn't politics (hint: evolution and gravity aren't POV either).  Related to the comic, I just had a similar rant on Facebook in the last week or two where I linked to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=54">this article</a> when someone said it was too cold for Global Warming. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.237.64" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.237.64">108.162.237.64</a> 12:24, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Actually evolution <i>is</i> a POV. For a start, it absolutely depends on the non-scientific assumption/philosophy/belief that there is nothing other than the material universe. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.222.227" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.222.227">108.162.222.227</a> 01:59, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

<p>I really hate it when people think the global warming scam is science, when it really is nothing more than politics masquerading as science.  The IPCC has been proven to be a bunch of liars, and really there's nothing left but a bunch of whining left-wing lunatics who are desperately clinging to their hope of continuing to use this lie to raise energy prices/taxes. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.17" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.17">108.162.219.17</a> 12:55, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Well you're wrong, and apparently delusionally paranoid about what the political left wants, but the bigger question is why is this in a wiki discussion page? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.249.117" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.249.117">108.162.249.117</a> 13:21, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>No, <i>you</i> are wrong, and still buying into the AGW myth that has been proven false (IPCC and others were basically caught lying).  Why is this in a wiki discussion page?  Well, apparently Randall has decided to use his webcomic as a vehicle to promote a left-wing agenda, so discussion of it here is totally legit. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.17" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.17">108.162.219.17</a> 14:03, 26 January 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think the most important words there are "his comic", so it's his call on what he writes. Also, honestly, the idea that climate change is a scam to control energy prices is pretty absurd.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Pennpenn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pennpenn (page does not exist)">Pennpenn</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Pennpenn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Pennpenn (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:39, 28 January 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Also, I thought it was well-known that Randall was a liberal.  He's made it pretty clear in the past which side of the fence he's on politically.  But that's beside the point, and I agree with 108.162.249.117: You honestly would have to deliberately choose to ignore the whole of the scientific community to believe that the concept of climate change is some sort of political scam.  It really isn't - you can see evidence of it everywhere, if only you were to open your eyes and take a look around you. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.120" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.120">108.162.246.120</a> 01:38, 29 January 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Evidence of what? That's what makes insistence so irrational and, when pushing policy, dangerous. With a millionth of geologic time in empirical evidence and tons of extrapolation, you've got daisy-chained assumptions all the way to end-times superstition. It's downright medieval. If the "scientific community" actually speculated that warming might lengthen growing seasons, expand habitability and bring other benefits, the effort might look somewhat objective. But instead, the only understanding of warming is ineluctable catastrophe straight out of a Hollywood screenplay. Seriously, step back and contemplate how insane that is. Every five years someone claims the world has five years left. Actually, I'd say "it was five years ago people claimed hurricane intensity would increase because reasons," but it was nine years ago, and nothing happened. Well, intensity dropped. And yet, ironically, like the characters in this strip, people desperate to believe in a meteorological eschatology will seize at anything -- anything at all -- to threaten and shame others for not accepting that industry means carbon dioxide means temperature change means&#160;??? means doom. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.86" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.86">108.162.221.86</a> 23:50, 30 January 2014 (UTC)

(And in the case of the Reef, the two major bleaching events in 1998 and 2002 occurred over just a few DAYS each.)  These are things that existed, mostly unchanged, for thousands of years and are suddenly disappearing or being damaged beyond repair.  The evidence is overwhelming.

There's nothing scientific on that. Especially considering how low is chance that any taxing would actually lower amount of carbon dioxide produced globally ... usually, it only causes businesses to relocate. Another thing I'm challenging is the "unprecedented" bit often used by global warming proponents.

<dl><dd>Okay, it wasn't clear earlier that your point was about USING climate-change as a means to scare people into paying taxes, etc.  I saw often-repeated arguments that climate-change ITSELF is a myth and a political football - that there's no proof it's happening.  I can understand questioning political actions taken as a result of the science, but the fact that the climate is changing is undisputable.</dd>
<dd>As for whether this form of climate change is unusual in the grand scale of time, you're right that we don't have detailed records going back more than a few hundred years, and ecologically speaking, that's not a long time.  But we DO have direct evidence that humans are responsible for a significant portion of the current change, including the incredibly sharp increase in global human population in just the last 100-150 years.  And my point is that there really are people out there who firmly believe the scientific community is smoking crack and promoting some dastardly political agenda, and all the photos and documentation of mass coral bleaching events, glacier and ice-cap melt, species extinctions, etc., are all elaborate hoaxes.

And politicians says we need to reduce carbon dioxide production and everything will be ok. It won't. We should start adapting. (Although stoping burning fossil fuels is also good idea, as I already said.) Also, we don't have direct measurements of those thousands of years. Proxy data are not as reliable as direct measurements AND are less reliable the further in past we get (because only the less reliable methods works for long periods). Now, about other points: the rise of human (and wheat) population may be MORE dangerous than the rise of industrial carbon dioxide, but it's not mentioned as often, because most politicians are not ready do DO something with rising human population (and the ones who DO - like Bashar al-Assad - are not doing it because of global warming). Also, the species extinction is certainly bad thing, but most species go extinct because of things totally unrelated to global warming - things more obviously caused by humans, BTW. Things which don't get as much coverage and support as global warming. Probably because there is not enough money there. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 10:31, 25 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>The reason that AGW gets more attention than overpopulation or habitat destruction is that (1) it's easier to quantify, (2) our current actions matter more, and (3) we have solutions that don't involve killing or starving people. If you're worried about water shortages due to overpopulation, those 3 reasons will stop you. (1) How much time and money do we have to actually invest, and how many people will it help; (2) why don't we just make that technology later when it becomes a problem; and (3) no one wants to touch the issue of restricting population growth to reduce land/water consumption. On the other hand, with AGW, it's easier. (1) We know the relative costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy, and we have tentative estimates of the damage climate change can cause. Also, the cost of a carbon tax and its effect on the economy aren't too hard to figure out; (2) we can't just push it under the rug like other issues. If we ignore it completely right now, we'll be stuck with a 5-10 degree F increase by 2100; and (3) It involves no killing or restricting basic rights - you can mitigate climate change just by setting taxes or trade quotas. Sure, those aren't particularly popular, but it's easier on the conscience than killing people off. Also, although the effects of climate change are sometimes exaggerated, they are still on the same level as the other ecological problems. Sure, our current 1.5 degrees of warming hasn't done much damage, but that's because it's within the earth's natural variation. Add on another 5+ degrees and it'll get tough for quite a few biomes. When a heat wave hits on top of that, you're just begging for extinctions, or at least a large drop in genetic diversity. I agree that other ecological issues are overshadowed by AGW in the media, but that doesn't discredit the importance of dealing with AGW.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.84" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.84">108.162.216.84</a> 04:50, 28 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Isn't the point of this one the fact that the cold days standing out being part of the point. People use rare cold snaps to question global warming, but they're ignoring the fact that the cold snap wouldn't be that out of the ordinary years ago.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.55.78" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.55.78">173.245.55.78</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:173.245.55.78&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:173.245.55.78 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>It's not GulfStream that matters, it's the proximity to the ocean that keeps the temperatures moderate. Seattle is located much farther North than St. Louis AND next to an arctic cold ocean stream, yet it's much warmer in the winter (and colder in the summer). The dry continental air has much higher temperature differences between the summer and winter. The pattern of the mountain chains in the North America tends to bring the cold arctic air from the North to the middle of the continent. Also, 0F/-18C is not brutally cold, it's moderately cold. -40 (either C or F) is brutally cold.

<dl><dd>I wrote that 0F/-18C is <i>fucking</i> cold, just to emphasize human feelings about that temperature. Someone changed this to <i>brutall</i>. And the Gulf Stream is just one example to show Europeans how different the climate can behave. And of course the northern American climate is not covered by this.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dgbrt" title="User:Dgbrt">Dgbrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Dgbrt" title="User talk:Dgbrt">talk</a>) 21:23, 2 February 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>To those of us who constantly live with much lower temperatures, that's not that cold at all. In fact, -18*C in the middle of winter would be a warm day. It'd be better to validate your statements with locational data supporting it, such as, "Floridians would go mad if it snowed" or "If all the snow melted on time, Canadians would go crazy". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.245.7" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.245.7">108.162.245.7</a> 14:22, 9 February 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>The (possibly un-informed) argument goes that there was a lot more pollution through the 1970s, but the Clean Air Act and EPA made a lot of it disappear, and the greenhouse gases produced by coal &amp; petroleum aren't counterbalanced by soot and particulates forming an artificial barrier to sunlight and heat. We look to the Little Ice Age, which persisted into the early Industrial Revolution, even though industrialised nations (Europe including Russia, the United States, and Canada) were burning coal like it was plentiful and unregulated. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.147.121" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.147.121">172.70.147.121</a> 22:28, 9 August 2021 (UTC)
