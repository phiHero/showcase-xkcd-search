<p>During election season in U.S. presidential elections — and especially in election night coverage — it is common for the media to make comments like the ones set out in the first panel of this comic. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall_Munroe" title="Randall Munroe">Randall</a> is demonstrating the problem with making such statements, many of which simply come down to coincidence.
</p><p>After the first panel the next 56 panels in this comic refer to each one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election#Electoral_college_results" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States presidential election">56 presidential elections</a> in U.S. history before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Barack Obama">Obama's</a> re-election in 2012. The panels depict a pre-election commentator noting a quality or condition that has never occurred to a candidate until one of the candidates in that election broke the streak. In other words, one can always find at least one unique thing about a candidate who has gone on to win (or in some cases, lose) or the circumstances under which they won (or lost) that is unique from all previous winners (or losers). It's worth noting that some of these 'firsts' were truly precedent-setting (such as the first incumbent losing, the first president to win a third term, the first Catholic president, etc.), but the fact that they hadn't happened was no assurance that there wouldn't be a first time. As the years pass on, these 'streaks' become more and more nested and complicated, and then brought by Randall to the point of absurdity by pointing out very trivial things, such as "No Democratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Incumbent">incumbent</a> without combat experience has ever beaten someone whose first name is worth more in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Scrabble">Scrabble</a>" (1996).
</p><p>The flaw made by pundits while reporting such streaks is that there will always be <i>something</i> that has never happened before in an election, and they purport to suggest that these things are related to the candidate's win or loss. Randall considers this a logical flaw. A common one is, as noted in several panels, candidates can't win without winning certain states. The question, however, is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Correlation does not imply causation">cause or effect</a>.
</p><p>Given that there have only been 56 elections, there are always going to be things that haven't happened before. If you go out looking for them, you're sure to find some. There is no magic about why these events haven't happened. In most cases, it is merely a coincidence.
</p><p>In the last two panels, two more statements like the previous are given. They were both true before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States presidential election, 2012">election in 2012</a> on November the 6th. The comic came out in the middle of the campaign on October the 17th. The statements were constructed so that the first predicts that Obama can't win over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</a>, and the second that he cannot lose. As Obama won the election he thus ended the streak <i>Democratic incumbents never beat taller challengers</i> whereas the other streak is still valid.
</p><p>The title text refers to the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Twitter">Twitter</a> was founded in 2006. Obama won in 2008, so at the time of the comic it was true that no white male person mentioned on Twitter had ever gone on to win the presidency; although certainly some former presidents, all of whom were white males, have subsequently been mentioned on Twitter. This streak was broken in the next election year when Donald Trump won the 2016 election.
</p><p>During these last four weeks before the election, Randall posted no fewer than four comics related to this election. The others are: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1127:_Congress" title="1127: Congress">1127: Congress</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1130:_Poll_Watching" title="1130: Poll Watching">1130: Poll Watching</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1131:_Math" title="1131: Math">1131: Math</a>.
</p><p>In 2020, Randall posted an update to this comic: <a href="/wiki/index.php/2383:_Electoral_Precedent_2020" title="2383: Electoral Precedent 2020">2383: Electoral Precedent 2020</a>.

<ul><li> There was an error in the original 1800 panel of the comic, as Jefferson (not Adams) was the first challenger to beat an incumbent, when Jefferson beat then-president Adams in 1800. This was later corrected.</li></ul>
<ul><li> The first president with a wig was technically Washington, who did not wear a wig, but in fact powdered his hair white. </li></ul>
<ul><li> Although Theodore Roosevelt became the first president under age 45 and was later elected president, he was not elected before the age of 45.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Also, one of the statements of a streak for the 2012 elections can be considered wrong: in 1952, the Republican candidate/running mate Eisenhower/Nixon defeated the Democratic alliterative ticket Stevenson/Sparkman (in what can only be described as a landslide). The comic has been changed, and now reads "Democratic incumbents never beat taller challengers" as the streak which would have the Republican ticket as the winners.</li></ul>

<p>You're technically wrong about Chuck Baldwin. He was born as Charles Baldwin. He only ran for vice president in '04 and president in '08.

<dl><dt>Errors</dt></dl>
<p>Should the errors be included in the article explanation, or should they just be discussed here in the chat box? I'm of the opinion that anything that doesn't go towards explaining the comic should go here in the discussion. I would lean towards keeping error nitpicking confined to the discussion page. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Davidy22" title="User:Davidy22">Davidy22</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Davidy22" title="User talk:Davidy22">talk</a>) 13:19, 18 October 2012 (UTC)

<p>I put back my original comment on the 2012 streaks; some anonymous person had previously written 'whether he thinks "st" and "sp" sounds are different enough to count as alliteration', but first of all, an alliteration requires the (first) sound(s)/letter(s) of two words to be the same (not different), and second, if Randall would consider Stevenson/Sparkman not to be alliterative (as their second letters differ), he would undoubtedly think the same about Romney/Ryan.--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jay (page does not exist)">Jay</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jay (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:11, 29 October 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Not quite true, Jay - St/Sp is two different consonant <i>blends</i>, which are much more intertwined than a consonant and its following vowel, as in Ro/Ry.

<p>Is it me or does the 1972 panel now say „Quakers can’t win twice“? What happened to „No wartime candidate has won without Massachusetts“? 
1956–1964 seem to be wrong, too. Or am I missing something?

<dl><dd>It's really funny because Trump is basically the king of Twitter politics/mud-slinging, I'm presuming that Randall didn't go back and change that alt-tag, because it was a safe bet that anyone coming after Obama would be another white guy, and anyone elected would be mentioned on twitter, but because Trump is so prolific on Twitter it makes the alt-text seem almost prophetic. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.58.251" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.58.251">172.68.58.251</a> 14:14, 4 April 2019 (UTC) Sam</dd></dl>
