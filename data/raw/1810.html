<p>The comic consists of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Euler diagram">Euler diagram</a> showing a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Online chat">chat systems</a> and their intersections. (Euler diagrams should not be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Venn diagram">Venn diagrams</a>, see more on this <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Venn_diagrams" title="Category:Venn diagrams">here</a>). The comic demonstrates the complexity that can be involved in modern communications: simply remembering how to get in touch with someone can be a challenge.
</p><p>Below is a <a href="#Chat_systems">table</a> with explanation for all 24 mentioned chat systems and below that a list of each system's <a href="#Euler_intersections">intersections</a> with the other systems. Several of the systems are already considered old, like <i>The "chat" tab in an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doc" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google Doc">Google Doc</a></i>, but some people keep using them, which is part of the joke. There only seems to be one "chat" system which could in no way be said to be an on-line chat system, and that is the <i>Wall (bathroom)</i> at the bottom, which refers to how people writes notes on public bathroom walls, making it an extra joke and possibly a reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/229:_Graffiti" title="229: Graffiti">229: Graffiti</a>.
</p><p>In the title text, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> explains how he is one of the only few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Instagram">Instagram</a> users to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:UNIX">UNIX</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_(software)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Talk (software)">'talk' gateway</a> (an old peer-to-peer chat system whereby users logged into the same UNIX system could privately communicate with each other in a full-screen interface.) But he doesn't tell how he had enhanced this old fashioned software.
</p><p>Note that this is similar to the earlier <a href="/wiki/index.php/949:_File_Transfer" title="949: File Transfer">949: File Transfer</a>.

There are many client and server plugins that provide access to other protocols (such as IRC-Hangouts, etc).

It is based on the closed source OSCAR protocol, but AOL created the TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications, and made specifications openly available, for third parties to connect to their service.  There have been short-lived dalliances with other protocols since 2008; it has never had direct support for the other widely used protocols here. Furthermore, it was discontinued on December 15, 2017, approximately nine months after the release of this comic.

<td>Like many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Web server">web servers</a>, Apache keeps a record of incoming requests -- both successful and unsuccessful -- in various log files. A conscientious webmaster will often review those logs, either to gauge interest in visited pages, or more importantly to detect failed requests that should not have failed, perhaps due to errors in the site's hotlinks which are therefore in need of cleanup.  If you know a particular webmaster who does this regularly, you can therefore send him/her a personal message by attempting to fetch a deliberately-nonexistent URL like <tt><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/Hey_Sandra_its_Pierce_wanna_have_a_drink_tonight.html">http://example.com/Hey_Sandra_its_Pierce_wanna_have_a_drink_tonight.html</a></tt>, knowing that the "message" will show up as a failed request in the logs.  This is a form of "back channel" communication, hardly practical as a true "chat system"<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, although an excellent in-joke among like-minded hackers.

<td>Wall (bathroom)
</td>

</td>
<td>This is the only "other" joke in the comic as this is the only "system" not on-line. Apparently it is a chat system based around writing on the wall in the bathroom. Not an electronic system. It may thus be a reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/229:_Graffiti" title="229: Graffiti">229: Graffiti</a>. Leaving messages on public bathroom walls is a common form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Graffiti">graffiti</a>. It may be used as a support for anonymous conversations. Alternatively, this could mean the person is an extreme introvert, and hides in his bathroom instead of interacting with others, by talking through the wall. It could also be a pun on "communicating through _____" as a bathroom wall is a physical object rather than an interface. It could also refer to someone who has a habit of talking through the wall to people in adjacent stalls of a public bathroom.
<p>Alternately, there used to be a Facebook App called Bathroom Wall, which was an anonymous message board where people could both post and reply to posts. This was all anonymous by default, but users could attach a nickname to each individual post or reply in order to maintain a continuity, and even have a full conversation. It's possible that this is what Randall meant for this group, seeing as it was indeed a way to communicate online.

<dd>Having communicated with nocturnal housemates by the method "leave a note where they will see it", it could also be a way of communicating with someone uncommunicative in your own house, alternative locations at our house being the bathroom mirror, the wall of the toilet room, and the kitchen fridge.

<dl><dd>I'd assume that the diagram is the ways Randall communicates with people. So the person in the Apache Logs circle would be the only person he is able to reach using this method.

<dl><dd>I'm also thinking about this. But the persons are some sticky figures like Cueball and so on; the character itself is unimportant...

<p>A possible method to transcribe the Euler diagram might be like this. Each intersection is a column, where the systems that intersect are marked with "X". The intersections that don't exist are left out.

<dl><dd>I've brought back some former agreed parts.

It's mainly trivia and transcript, and it's still incomplete because all the intersections have to be explained. Randall uses the Euler diagram NOT for the sticky figures, the intersections are important.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dgbrt" title="User:Dgbrt">Dgbrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Dgbrt" title="User talk:Dgbrt">talk</a>) 14:39, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>But when a third party (I) put a table together explaining the intersections, you took it out again, with the comments "Please avoid useless tables and describe the intersections" and "Do not count the sticky figures. Randall has more than 35 email contacts. The figures are only a filler!"</dd>
<dd>I think this is a misunderstanding of the comic. The figures are not a filler at all; they are exactly what is important here. They represent people whom Randall can contact by various means. There is no other meaning to the intersections.</dd>
<dd>The point about Randall's having more than 35 email contacts is well taken. Perhaps the individual figures represent quantity groupings. One figure means a small number of friends, two a medium number, three a large number, and five a very large number. Or perhaps this is a sample of 57 of his friends. Or perhaps this is really all the people he regularly communicates with for social reasons. But whatever the explanation, I think it's meaningful that there are more figures within the iMessage set than within the Skype set.</dd>
<dd>I will admit to being mystified, though, by the empty intersections: iMessage with Signal, FB Messenger with non-SMS, and Twitter DM with email but not SMS. Those don't really fit my theory.</dd>

<dl><dd>Your <i>perhaps'</i> doesn't explain anything. And one more: Only two in WhatsApp? Really? Is email so much larger than WhatsApp? Believe me, an Euler diagram is used for showing <i>relevant intersections</i>. And these intersections are possibly Randall specific because for example Skype is a little bit odd. SMS is a feature in Skype but that's not shown in the diagram. You may count the numbers but they are irrelevant.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dgbrt" title="User:Dgbrt">Dgbrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Dgbrt" title="User talk:Dgbrt">talk</a>) 08:58, 17 March 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I really do not know why I keep trying to reach Dgbrt because he seems to have decided to be against anything I do. But after taking a few days off from him and explain xkcd I went back to look at my "massive edits" and found almost none. For the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Talk:1805:_Unpublished_Discoveries" title="Talk:1805: Unpublished Discoveries">second time</a> Dgbrt looks only on the red part in his link to my edits, not at the text or the actual changes. And for the second time the red appears because one or more paragraphs is moved or inserted. Then the existing paragraphs do not match and all becomes red. I went through all paragraphs and explained what I had done and what was changed. And it turned out that the only think I actually deleted was the incomplete reason and the first paragraph. But because I moved the incomplete reason into the explain section everything below moved down and became red. Here below is my findings to revert Dgbrts fall claims that I changed everything. And I really believe the transcript is all wrong as it is now! </dd></dl>
<ol><li>I moved the incomplete reason below the explanation section. And tried to do exactly what is said originally while mentioning what now needed updating. This made a lot of the rest red without I had changed much. This was the same the previous time you complained about red all over after my edits!</li>
<li>I changed the first paragraph which was really poorly written. Also there was really no connection to Venn diagrams but it seems there had been some confusion. So instead of explaining Venn diagram in the comic I made a ref to the category and made a general example there to be used in other situations. I think this is a great idea, which probably is another point we disagree, but that is not the point here. But it made the start of the explanation easier to read without removing the possibility to understand Venn vs Euler.</li>
<li>The second paragraph is mainly red because of the extra paragraph from moving incomplete: I only added this: “and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Social_networking" title="Category:Social networking">social networking</a>”</li>
<li>As I put the chat system table into a new section (which is the usually way, also making it possible to edit the table and the main explanation simultaneously) then I put in a paragraph linking to it. Here I explained shortly a few things without changing anyone’s contributions.</li>
<li>The title text was only briefly mentioned, but I did not delete anything. It was the extra paragraphs again that made it red. I added the explanation from the table. Tables is often used for the main comic, and the title text is explained in the main explanation. So I did not add or change, just move two title text explanations together into one.</li>
<li>Then there was the “Related comics” below the table, which is not the place for these. So I moved them up above the table, someone added a third comic and I added two more. Again I did not delete anything.</li>
<li>In the table I only fixed one link and mentioned that the WC wall is the only “joke” in the main comic. And then moved the title text out of table.</li>
<li>As I think you have mentioned explanations and very long descriptions should not go into the transcript. So I moved the intersection description out. I think it is important, but should maybe even down in a trivia? But definitely not be in the transcript. </li>
<li>I did thus not delete anything from the transcript, but kept only the text actually written in the comic. OK I added more to the explanation in brackets, maybe too much for your taste, but again that is not a debate about my “aggressive” edit here. We also disagree on that.</li>
<li>Finally I added the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/ef/1810_Chat_System_numbered.PNG">image with character numbers</a> and the number of characters in the trivia. Of course you have deleted that as well? It added a way to discuss different characters and also made it clear that there where 57!</li></ol>
<dl><dd>So as you can see from this I did not really delete anything except the first paragraph. Which I mainly just rewrote. I cannot understand the idea that you should not edit a wiki because it might hurt other editors. What is the point then. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:20, 19 March 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>I'm amused to note that I'm a great example of how this is Euler, not Venn: The best way to contact me is FB Message, with SMS a close second. I almost never get real emails anymore, so I don't check it much. But as the entire FB group is inside the Email group, I couldn't go in there.&#160;:) As for the current Incomplete explanation, I would say it's fairly self explanatory. For example, said FB Messenger group. We have a Ponytail, who is also in the iMessage, SMS, and Email groups, meaning that Randall can talk to her using FB messenger, iMessage, SMS, or by Email. Meanwhile the Cueball in this group is in the same groups except for iMessage, meaning Randall can talk to him using FB messenger, SMS, or by Email, in other words in the same ways as (this) Ponytail except iMessage. Going into detail listing every combination represented and what they mean seems like it would be too long and tedious (and would beg for identifying the combinations which aren't represented, which would be worse).
</p><p>BTW, there used to be a Facebook App called Bathroom Wall (later changed for a short time to Bathroom Stall, because Facebook decided to forbid anything called Wall), which was an anonymous message board. Not a chat system per se, but it WAS an online communication tool. Messages were anonymous by default, but you could identify yourself through an optional nickname (much like I do here). Within a thread you could faithfully keep using the same nickname in order to maintain a conversation. I had understood THIS was what Randall meant (since it IS actually a way to communicate, unlike actual bathrooms, and is electronic, unlike actual walls). However, this app was closed years ago because it attracted fighting. People wouldn't stop, Facebook pushed the creators to do something about it, they eventually felt forced to close it. They put it into read-only mode for a while so people could salvage whatever was meaningful to them, then it was gone. The fact that it no longer exists would seem to be a vote against it being what Randall meant, except for the other clearly outdated methods on here (I miss ICQ). - NiceGuy1 <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.126.76" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.126.76">162.158.126.76</a> 03:47, 22 March 2017 (UTC) I finally signed up!

"had its beginnings in the 1980s and has since represented the most common form of data transmission for most people." Wait, are SMSs really used that much?

<dl><dd>Well at least not in the past few couple of years, since everyone has a smartphone and internet flatrate, so they use free and more flexible services (such as WhatsApp) instead.
