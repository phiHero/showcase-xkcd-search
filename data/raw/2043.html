<p>Most English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:English compound">compound nouns</a> can be constructed recursively. In many cases they are written <i>open</i> or <i>spaced</i> like "piano player" (a player of a piano.) But <i>closed</i> forms like "wallpaper" (paper for a wall) are not less common.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> is engaging in creative linguistics again. This time he is humorously suggesting to use a consistent naming scheme for things holding other things, the same way we call a boat holding a house a houseboat. He is extending this to all combinations boats, houses and cars. This would, however, be somewhat impractical, as these names do not include why one thing is on an other, and are also sometimes ambiguous: a carcar can be a tow truck as much as a car carrier, and a househouse can be either an apartment (house in a house) or an apartment building (house containing houses).
</p><p>Additionally, he is somewhat inconsistent in some parts of the chart. While the chart is supposed to show examples of neologistic compound words &lt;x&gt;&lt;y&gt; that refer to a &lt;y&gt; that <i>holds</i> an &lt;x&gt;, rather than a &lt;y&gt; <i>in</i> an &lt;x&gt;. However, Randall's examples sometimes are those of the latter example. He proposes to call lifeboats, which are boats held by other boats, "boatboat", instead of using that to refer to boats holding other boats, such as floating drydocks. Additionally, it is established naval practice to refer to a boat which is carried by another vessel as a "ship's boat", and call any vessel that carries a boat a "ship". In other words, according to usual naval terminology, a "boatboat" is a contradiction in terms; it is either a "boatship", synonymous with ship and hence redundant, or a "shipboat", the ship's boat. "Apartment" is a similar case: an apartment is a house in a house, while a house that holds a house is an apartment building or apartment complex. (However, in the title text, Randall points out an &lt;x&gt;&lt;y&gt; could also refer to a &lt;y&gt; in an &lt;x&gt;, similar to the lifeboat and apartment examples. Nevertheless, "lifeboat" and "apartment" do not fit with the rest of the items of the chart and disobey the rule annotated in the corner.)
</p><p>In the title text: "Truck food" is in some areas a common term for the meals offered by "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_truck" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Food truck">food trucks"</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_phone" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Car phone">Car phones</a> were a feature in automobiles throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, serving as the predecessors to mobile phones, although they were permanently installed into a car and not removable. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananaphone" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bananaphone">Bananaphone</a></i>, a song by Raffi Cavoukian, is also mentioned.

<dd>A “house car” is a motor vehicle originally designed, or permanently altered, and equipped for human habitation, or to which a camper has been permanently attached. A motor vehicle to which a camper has been temporarily attached is not a house car except that, for the purposes of Division 11 (commencing with Section 21000) and Division 12 (commencing with Section 24000), a motor vehicle equipped with a camper having an axle that is designed to support a portion of the weight of the camper unit shall be considered a three-axle house car regardless of the method of attachment or manner of registration.

<dd> Yes, but that's still not a "mobile home". It's a "motor home" in most states, e.g. Oregon. ORS 801.350 says "'Motor home' means a motor vehicle that: (1) Is reconstructed, permanently altered or originally designed to provide facilities for human habitation; or (2) Has a structure permanently attached to it that would be a camper if the structure was not permanently attached to the motor vehicle." I'm fine with Randall calling this a housecar, but he's wrong when he says the conventional name for it is mobile home. "Mobile home" is a colloquial term for a manufactured home that is delivered on wheels and then usually has its wheels removed, so it becomes stationary for the rest of its life. That's definitely not a housecar. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.149" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.149">108.162.246.149</a> 15:38, 10 September 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Randall did just correct the comic. The first version said "this [row] held by this [column]", which would have meant, that e.g. a towtruck is a car held by a car, which is just wrong. It has just be updated to the correct "a this [column] that holds a this [row]". I do not know how to change that here. Should be mentioned in Trivia <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 16:11, 7 September 2018 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thanks for your eagle eyes. I've uploaded the new version, please be patient until the cache is expired and you can see it. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dgbrt" title="User:Dgbrt">Dgbrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Dgbrt" title="User talk:Dgbrt">talk</a>) 16:48, 7 September 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Just edited this Trivia section, as the change is more stylistic, rather than a change in meaning. Randall simply changes from the passive voice. "[Row] held by [Column]" is equivalent to "A [Column] that holds a [Row]". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.75.154" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.75.154">162.158.75.154</a> 14:35, 10 September 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It is not just a change of style, it also changes which one are right and which are wrong. A tow truck is something that holds something, while, an appartment is something held by something, so in either case some are wrong, and he just changed which ones. But most important: in the first version the example of boat house was wrong, as by his definition it was a boat held by a house, which is not true. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 18:52, 15 September 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>well... with the original version it fits. a boat held by another boat is a lifeboat.

<dd>I've always heard that a ship is a boat that's big enough to carry other boats. If it carries a lifeboat, then it's a ship. Submarines do not have lifeboats, so they are called "boats" not ships. Inflatable rafts don't count. A sailboat that carries an inflatable raft is still a boat. And yes, there is such a thing as a ship that carries other ships. Google the Blue Marlin. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.106.90" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.106.90">162.158.106.90</a> 15:43, 10 September 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> Agreed. His list of words contains elements that fall into either the 'x held by y' or 'x that holds y' definition, so neither definition can work for all the words!

<p>You're entirely correct on both counts. Lifeboats are carried by other boats, and ships that can carry other ships do exist. This comic also fails to distinguish between boats and ships, and cars, trucks, and trailers.
While a Boathouse is indeed a house for boats, a boat <i>trailer</i> is usually a trailer and not a car- the name already follows Randell's suggested logic: it's a trailer (characterized by lacking it's own engine, steering, and driver's cabin) that holds one or more boats. In addition, both tow trucks and car carriers are large enough to be properly referred to as trucks (the smallest type of tow truck I know of is built on a pickup truck chassis) and are fully capable to towing or carrying other trucks as well as cars, making the term carcar inaccurate. Yes, I'm being pedantic, but this might be worth mentioning in explanation. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.122.60" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.122.60">162.158.122.60</a> 16:44, 7 September 2018 (UTC)Chris Long

<dl><dd>Each of the compound words that Randall has made up here are still "correct" - but general. The failure to distinguish between multiple examples isn't a "bug" here; it's a feature of the productive nature of novel compounding in English. Each of 'apartment', 'tow truck' and 'lifeboat' should be treated as <i>an</i> example of 'househouse', 'carcar' and 'boatboat', respectively, but given the way English treats novel compounds, they can't be the <i>only</i> examples.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.150.76" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.150.76">172.68.150.76</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:172.68.150.76&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:172.68.150.76 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
<dl><dd>He tries to get a logic in there, as in the difference between boathouse and houseboat, to show which supports which, but fails to do so.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I wouldn't read too much into it. This comic is, of course, lighthearted in nature, and I'm pretty sure Randall doesn't <i>literally</i> hold these views and call for the creation of a "carcar" or something. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.46.41" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.46.41">172.68.46.41</a> 04:35, 8 September 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>To continue the convention, "boatboat", as a "life-boat" is a mistake. But i don't think Randall is much of a practical sailor. He lives inland, and probably isn't nearly as familiar with ships as he is with cars. more correct choices to repeat the convention used elsewhere in the comic, could easily be tugboat, carrier ship, or barge. sep 8, guest  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.62.57" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.62.57">162.158.62.57</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:162.158.62.57&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:162.158.62.57 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

</p><p><b>Compounding nouns</b>
</p><p>As a native German speaker I've learned in school that compounding nouns in German like "Hausboot" are always written as "house boat" in English, the nouns do not form to a new single noun. And I'm still sure that "Hausbootbriefkasten" (Haus-boot-brief-kasten) still translates literally to something like "house boats letter box" in the original Oxford English domain, while "letterbox of a houseboat" is probably the much better translation. Nonetheless the order at the German <i>looong</i> noun is still correct: There's a box, for a letter, on a boat, which supports a house. And a record holder in German: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizit%C3%A4tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft">Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft</a>, even Germans are annoyed... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dgbrt" title="User:Dgbrt">Dgbrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Dgbrt" title="User talk:Dgbrt">talk</a>) 20:31, 7 September 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>We do obviously have closed compounds as well (and hyphenated ones), but most people aren't going to consider "house boat" annoyingly incorrect, but "snowski" would be jarring, so that is a good rule of thumb you were taught. And I would translate "Hausbootbriefkasten" as "houseboat's mailbox" (or letterbox where people call mailboxes letterboxes) as the X's Y form typically sounds more natural than Y of (the) X, even though they mean basically the same thing. Y of the X is more for archaic or stilted speech, except in a few phrases like "end of the line" and "root of the problem." We just usually stop closed compounds at 2 or maybe 3 parts in English. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.48.99" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.48.99">173.245.48.99</a> 20:51, 14 September 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>If a boat that carries a boat is called a ship, should "ship" be in the boatboat square instead of "lifeboat"? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.62.64" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.62.64">172.69.62.64</a> 01:37, 8 September 2018 (UTC)

</p><p><b>1984, anyone?</b>
</p><p>I was just reading this explanation and when I read the sentence "Randall is engaging in creative linguistics again" I just thought: No, he's applying Newspeak. While - of course - the words here are not to be found in the novel 1984 (at least I'm not aware of them) they sound like something that would be created if Newspeak was lifted to the next level - reduce the number of individual words and try to express as much as possible with compounds of the remaining words.
