<p>During a casual talk with <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> suddenly interrupts her normal speech stating that she is for some reason only capable of controlling her own voice once every six years. Apparently only for a very brief time since she immediately returns to the casual talk, continuing her previous sentence mid-word before being able to tell Megan how she could help her. Upon Megan's confused request, she denies knowledge of the occurrence, although in a somewhat suspicious way, using possibly fake laughter.
</p><p>It could be this was just a prank by Ponytail, to tease Megan, but given her fake laughter reply to Megan's inquiry and the continuing comment in the title text it seems most likely that Ponytail is indeed possessed by some sort of entity that prevents her from expressing her own thoughts, except for a very short time every six years. Of course this may just be her way of continuing with the prank; see a previous case of such a prank <a href="#Voice_hijacking">below</a>.
</p><p>In case it is not a prank it would thus appear that Ponytail's usual "self" is indeed this possessing entity. Whether this entity is actually aware that the "real" Ponytail did speak, or if it actually does not know that it was interrupted (since it continued mid-word) is not clear from the last response to Megan.
</p><p>The title text suggests that Ponytail <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySnatcher"><span style="background: #eef;" title="Warning: TV Tropes. See comic 609.">is possessed by some sort of inhuman entity</span></a>, most likely an alien or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:AI">AI</a>, unfamiliar with movies and eating. See below for <a href="#Related_comics">related comics</a>.

<p>The comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1530:_Keyboard_Mash" title="1530: Keyboard Mash">1530: Keyboard Mash</a>, also revolves around the same theme of a non-human entity trying to convince other humans that it is in fact a human. This is most clearly referenced in the title text of this comic. In Keyboard Mash, it is a spider that tries to chat like it was a human, making statements that are true if you are human, but which humans would never utter in a conversation like here - <i>put some food in our normal mouths!</i> However, the pretended 'human' being (the spider) is not seen by the other person in this comic. As opposed to this one where Megan speaks directly with Ponytail.

<p>It has already been established recently, in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1528:_Vodka" title="1528: Vodka">1528: Vodka</a>, that Ponytail's voice can be hijacked by non-human entities. That time it was the vodka she was drinking that took over. It is possible that this is continuing or caused by the same openness to possession as shown here. It is also possible that she simply thinks possession jokes are funny and once again jokes with Megan.

<p>Six years ago today, which according to this comic was the last time Ponytail had control of her own voice, this comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/600:_Android_Boyfriend" title="600: Android Boyfriend">600: Android Boyfriend</a> was posted. Ponytail acquired an android boyfriend. It seems unlikely that this older comic has any relation with this particular episode - except that this comic mentions a six-year period and Ponytail is also in that comic.

<p><i>Ponytail is mainly a filler character, showing up when two females are needed or when a large group of people are present.</i>
</p><p>It is important to note that <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a>, like most xkcd <a href="/wiki/index.php/stick_figure" class="mw-redirect" title="stick figure">stick figures</a>, usually does not represent the same character in each comic. This Ponytail is likely unrelated to other instances of Ponytail.

<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Demonic possession">Possession</a> stories are common in films and books. Some recent examples that could have inspired this comic could be one of these (beware of <b>spoilers</b>):
<ul><li>In the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Host_(2013_film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Host (2013 film)">The Host</a> the human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called "Souls" that inserts themselves individually into a host body where they are then able to access the host's memories. In the story the main character is the host that controls a body, and then the personality of that body, which is then no longer able to control her body, but can speak to the host. And in a few situations can take over her body for a short period. Very similar to what happens in this comic.</li>
<li>The Yeerks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animorphs_(TV_series)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Animorphs (TV series)">Animorphs</a> TV series take humans as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The host can fight to temporarily take back control, but this is very painful. However how many times human can fight back is not as specific as in this comic. Animorph is referenced in a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Animorphs" title="Category:Animorphs">a few other comics</a>.</li>
<li>In the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_John_Malkovich" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Being John Malkovich">Being John Malkovich</a> the main character possesses Malkovich, but Malkovich is occasionally able to communicate through the possession.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Warlord (Star Trek: Voyager)">an episode</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Trek: Voyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a>, Kes is taken over by a warlord who has discovered a means of immortality by using technology to transfer his consciousness to another body. The warlord enters a mental struggle with Kes's latent mind, and as he begins to lose the battle, Kes's personality resurfaces on several occasions.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The premise of this comic reminds me of a sci-fi short story I read many years ago but have never been able to track down. A young girl's doll (?) comes to life, and it explains that it is a entity that can inhabit inanimate objects. Some things happen that I have forgotten, and while walking down the road, the girl is almost struck by a runaway car. The entity takes control of the car and steers it away from her. It decides that, having saved the girl's life, it has every right to take control of her - leaving our poor protagonist in the worst kind of "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" scenario as the story ends. Perhaps Randall Munroe read the same story. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.212" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.212">141.101.98.212</a> 12:08, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>To me it reminds me of the movie "Being John Malkovich", especially the end, where the main character is forever trapped in the other person's body, unable to talk. Kind of the-other-way-around, but a similar concept. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Linuspogo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Linuspogo (page does not exist)">Linuspogo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Linuspogo" title="User talk:Linuspogo">talk</a>) 12:23, 22 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Actually, it's very much like The Silver Chair from The Chronicles of Narnia where someone is enchanted most of the time, and only in their right mind for a short time every day. They have a short time to convince those around them that they are now in their right mind. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mlv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mlv (page does not exist)">Mlv</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mlv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mlv (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:33, 24 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>The phrase "..and put food in our normal mouths" (trying to pass as a human but getting it wrong) reminded me of 629: Skins "..been driving my car and having a job all day .. didn't meow once." <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.53.105" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.53.105">173.245.53.105</a> 16:15, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

Randall will have to break his regular schedule for a small easter egg that would then be 12 years in the making.

<dl><dd> Not to me. It's the same characters chatting casually, but there's nothing else linking both comics. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/188.114.111.224" title="Special:Contributions/188.114.111.224">188.114.111.224</a> 15:11, 22 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>By the way, I'd think that, even if Ponytail can't control her voice, she still can write whatever she wants. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/188.114.111.224" title="Special:Contributions/188.114.111.224">188.114.111.224</a> 15:15, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd> "Voice" in one sense could mean the use of vocal cords and mouth to produce audible speech, but in a more general sense it can be used to describe any verbal or nonverbal communication. (eg right now I am voicing my opinion on this subject) I suspect the latter is being implied here, although like most of the comics it's open to interpretation. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tahg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tahg (page does not exist)">Tahg</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tahg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tahg (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:10, 22 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Animorphs reference?</dt></dl>
<p>xkcd has mentioned that franchise before- <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1380/">https://xkcd.com/1380/</a>
It centers around an alien race named the Yeerks that effectively possess a host by entering the brain. There is a single character in that series (Marco's mother) that is on rare occasions able to break through the Yeerk's control to use her own voice. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.12" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.12">141.101.99.12</a> 15:23, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>Agreed, this was my first impression of the comic. --Elimist--
</p>
<dl><dd>The Yeerks have full access to the host's thoughts, feelings, and memories.  They are literally wrapped around the brain.  They are completely indistinguishable and would not act suspicious in a personality sense.  The only things that give them away are their required actions, such as returning to the pool every few days, or if they get caught in a conversation with their conspirators. The only reason Jake's status as host was discovered in one novel was because the Yeerk had only just entered his brain and didn't have time to fully acquire his memories.  The Yeerk's sudden and unexpected exposure to what he believed to be the Andalite bandits lead him to have an emotional outburst. Had he been given any amount of time to adjust to his new host, he would have gone unnoticed until he had to return to the pool. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.210.153" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.210.153">108.162.210.153</a> 18:49, 22 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>My first thought was Randal must be talking about party obsessed people who are in fact out of control over their acting and helpless having to go out even if they don't have a reason to --floydheld--
</p><p>This reminded me of the movie "The Host", where a human body is used to receive a voyaging alien entity. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.123" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.123">108.162.219.123</a> 18:37, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
</p><p><b>Ponytail as filler character:</b>
"Note on Ponytail: She is mainly a filler character..." - maybe she has never got her own voice because she is used as a filler character?

</p><p>Removed the Yeerk mention, because while Yeerk hosts can occasionally act against their controller this isn't how they work, so this really probably isn't a reference to Animorphs (as much as I like the books). -Pennpenn <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.162" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.162">108.162.250.162</a> 23:29, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>When I first read it, I interpreted it as some other intelligence was being suppressed by Ponytail, rather than the other way around, as it is currently being explained.

<dl><dd>Completely unrelated to the comic, but the above was subverted in the 2015 Comic Relief night (the umpteenth UK one, that is, seeing as the US seem to have started doing it) in a comedy sketch involving Stephen Hawking in a Little Britain setting.  He apparently <i>wants</i> to swear, but his autocorrect bowdlerises his attempts.  I'm not sure if the humour(-with-a-'u') will travel, but it's probably on YouTube if you want to look for it.</dd>
<dd><i>More</i> related to the comic, Stephen was 'stuck' with an American accent with his original voice synthesiser unit, but it's now so much part of him and his popular image that he keeps it.  <i>Normally</i> representing what he wants to say, it seems.  Though maybe the reason behind his recent comments about the dangers of advanced AI is that (of all people), an aspiring AI Overlord could quite easily impersonate him and control his life, to its own ends, with people (certainly outside his usual immediate contacts) being unable to tell that he's actually in the midst of an "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">I Have No Voice And I Must Scream</a>" scenario.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.30" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.30">141.101.98.30</a> 16:01, 24 June 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Sean Spicer said that the "covfefe" tweet was not a mistake and "I think the President and a small group of people know exactly what he meant."
</p><p>Suppose the President of the United States of America was in Ponytail's situation, and the "real" Donald Trump was only able to assert itself long enough to tweet seven characters before the possessing entity regained control.  Or perhaps four, because the original tweet was "Despite the constant negative press covfefe", and it has been suggested that he was attempting to tweet something beginning with "Despite the constant negative press coverage...", which would mean that the suppressed entity took control after the "v" and tweeted only "fefe" before losing control again.
</p><p>That would explain a lot.  Well, a little.  Well, very little.  Almost nothing really.
</p><p>What could a possessed person be trying to communicate with those letters that would have a meaning that Sean Spicer would think was known to Trump and a "small group" of others (presumably those aware of the possession)?
</p><p>Perhaps the possessor was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fefe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fefe">Fefe</a>.  Or if it's not a possession but rather an android or robot that can impersonate a human and pass the Turing test, most of the time, my guess is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_von_Leitner" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Felix von Leitner">Felix von Leitner</a>, because of the various individuals called Fefe, he is the most likely to know how and he's the type of guy that Randall finds fascinating.
