<p>This comic says that a password such as "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3" is bad because it is easy for password cracking software and hard for humans to remember, leading to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post-it attached to the monitor. On the other hand, a password such as "correct horse battery staple" is hard for computers to guess due to having more entropy but quite easy for humans to remember.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Entropy (information theory)">Entropy</a> is a measure of "uncertainty" in an outcome. In this context, it can be thought of as a value representing how unpredictable the next character of of a password is. It is calculated as <i>log2(a^b)</i> where <i>a</i> is the number of allowed symbols and <i>b</i> is its length.
</p><p>A truly random string of length 11 (not like "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3", but more like "J4I/tyJ&amp;Acy") has log2(94^11) = 72.1 bits, with 94 being the total number of letters, numbers, and symbols one can choose. However the comic shows that "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3" has only 28 bits of entropy. This is because the password follows a simple pattern of a dictionary word + a couple extra numbers or symbols, hence the entropy calculation is more appropriately expressed with log2(65000*94*94), with 65000 representing a rough estimate of all dictionary words people are likely to choose. (For related info, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/</a>).
</p><p>Another way of selecting a password is to have 2048 "symbols" (common words) and select only 4 of those symbols. log2(2048^4) = 44 bits, much better than 28. Using such symbols was again visited in one of the tips in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1820:_Security_Advice" title="1820: Security Advice">1820: Security Advice</a>.
</p><p>It is absolutely true that people make passwords hard to remember because they think they are "safer", and it is certainly true that length, all other things being equal, tends to make for very strong passwords and this can be confirmed by using <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php">rumkin.com's password strength checker</a>. Even if the individual characters are all limited to [a-z], the exponent implied in "we added another lowercase character, so multiply by 26 again" tends to dominate the results.
</p><p>In addition to being easier to remember, long strings of lowercase characters are also easier to type on smartphones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_keyboard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Virtual keyboard">soft keyboards</a>.
</p><p>xkcd's password generation scheme requires the user to have a list of 2048 common words (log<sub>2</sub>(2048) = 11). For any attack we must assume that the attacker knows our password generation algorithm, but not the exact password. In this case the attacker knows the 2048 words, and knows that we selected 4 words, but not which words. The number of combinations of 4 words from this list of words is (2<sup>11</sup>)<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>44</sup>, i.e. 44 bits. For comparison, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#calculatingentropy">entropy offered by Diceware's 7776 word list is 13 bits per word</a>. If the attacker doesn't know the algorithm used, and only knows that lowercase letters are selected, the "common words" password would take even longer to crack than depicted. 25 <i>random</i> lowercase characters would have <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log2%2826^25%29">117 bits of entropy</a>, vs 44 bits for the common words list.
</p>
<dl><dt>Example</dt></dl>
<p>Below there is a detailed example which shows how different rules of complexity work to generate a password with supposed 44 bits of entropy. The examples of expected passwords were generated in random.org.(*)
</p><p>If <i>n</i> is the number of symbols and <i>L</i> is the length of the password, then <i>L</i> = 44 / log<sub>2</sub>(n).

<li> Diogo Mónica is correct that a truly random 8-character string is still stronger than a truly random 4-word string (52.4 vs 44), but doesn't understand that the words have to be truly random, not user-selected phrases like "let me in facebook":  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://diogomonica.com/posts/password-security-why-the-horse-battery-staple-is-not-correct/">Password Security: Why the horse battery staple is not correct</a></li>
<li> Ken Munro confuses entropy with permutations and undermines his own argument that "correct horse battery staple" is weak due to dictionary attacks by giving an example "strong" password that still consists of English words. He also doesn't realize that using capital letters in predictable places (first letter of every word) does not increase password strength: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/correcthorsebatterystaple-isnt-a-good-password-heres-why/">CorrectHorseBatteryStaple isn’t a good password.

<p><i>Fix the software first.</i>  If you double the time it takes to enter each repeated password attempt you make brute force attacks pointless.   Imagine you allowed a hurried user who screws up their own password entry w/ frozen fingers. If their system starts out with a 1 second delay, then doubles to two, then to four, etc. the time it takes to wait is 2^n.

My advise to most people is to use a password manager like lastpass or onepass that can generate pure random password. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.253.6" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.253.6">162.158.253.6</a> 23:52, 10 March 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>No you don't.  Hackers cannot run a dictionary attack against a string of four randomly picked words.
Look at the number of bits displayed in the image: 11 bits for each word.
That means he's assuming a dictionary of 2048 words, from which each word is picked randomly.
The assumption is that the cracker knows your password scheme.

<dl><dd> 1) ... as compared to 69 milliseconds for the other method. 2) Since you are able to test 3,9 billion passwords as second (very impressive!) I am guessing that your setup is not performing its attack over a ”weak remote service”, which is breaking the rules of the #936 game. 3) five words and a 20k-wordlist would get you 9400 years (still breaking the weak remote service rule).--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Gnirre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gnirre (page does not exist)">Gnirre</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gnirre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gnirre (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:13, 14 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> 2) Two thoughts: You use itertools.permutations, which only covers non-repeating words, but mainly you don't actually hash the password. If you have a plain-text password, there no need to crack the password because you could just look at it. Example of an actual crack for this type of password: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/koshippy/xkcd_password/blob/master/password_crack.py">https://github.com/koshippy/xkcd_password/blob/master/password_crack.py</a> My computer gets 10,000,000 guesses in ~16 seconds (non-hashed takes ~2 seconds), meaning it would take almost a year to try every combination. (2048^4 total password space). Even optimizing by using c++/java or JtR, you wouldn't see huge improvement since most of the time is from the SHA hashing. Point being: a typical user can't crack this type of password in a short amount of time, even if they know your wordlist. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.128.212" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.128.212">199.27.128.212</a> 12:05, 17 February 2015 (UTC) Koshippy</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Sometimes this is not possible. (I'm looking at you, local banks with 8-12 character passwords and PayPal) If I can, I use a full sentence. A compound sentence for the important stuff. This adds the capitalization, punctuation and possibly the use of numbers while it's even easier to remember then Randall's scheme. I think it might help against the keyloggers too, if your browser/application autofills the username filed, because you password doesn't stand out from the feed with being gibberish. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/195.56.58.169" title="Special:Contributions/195.56.58.169">195.56.58.169</a> 09:01, 30 August 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>The basic concept can be adapted to limited-length passwords easily enough: memorize a phrase and use the first letter of each word. It'll require about a dozen words (you're only getting 4.7 bits per letter at best, actually less because first letters of words are not truly random, though they are weakly if at all correlated with their neighbors -- based on the frequencies of first letters of words in English, and assuming no correlation between each first letter and the next, I calculate about 4 bits per character of Shannon entropy). SteveMB 18:35, 30 August 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Followup: The results of extracting the first letters of words in sample texts (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Project Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a> texts of <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, and <i>Little Fuzzy</i>) and applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Entropy (information theory)">Shannon entropy calculation</a> were 4.07 bits per letter (i.e. first letter in word) and 8.08 bits per digraph (i.e. first letters in two consecutive words). These results suggest that first-letter-of-phrase passwords have approximately 4 bits per letter of entropy. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:SteveMB&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:SteveMB (page does not exist)">SteveMB</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:SteveMB&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:SteveMB (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:21, 4 September 2013 (UTC)

In fact it's a word list, which seems similar but it's not. All the words in the word list must be easy to memorize. This means it's better not to have words such as <i>than</i> or <i>if</i>. Also, it's better not to have homophones (<i>wood</i> and <i>would</i>, for example). The sentence <i>dictionary attack</i> doesn't apply here. A dictionary attack requires the attacker to use all the words in the dictionary (e.g. 100,000 words). Here we must generate the 17,592,186,044,416 combinations of 4 common words. Those combinations can't be found in any dictionary.

</p><p>This comic was mentioned in a TED talk by Lorrie Faith Cranor on in March 2014. After performing a lot of studies and analysis, she concludes that "pass phrase" passwords are no easier to remember than complex passwords and that the increased length of the password increases the number of errors when typing it. There is a lot of other useful information from her studies that can be gleaned from the talk. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/lorrie_faith_cranor_what_s_wrong_with_your_pa_w0rd">Link</a>. What she doesn't mention is the frequency of changing passwords - in most organizations it's ~90 days. I don't know where that standard originated, but (as a sys admin) I suspect it's about as ineffective as most of our other password trickery - that is that it does nothing. Today's password thieves don't bash stolen password hash tables, they bundle keyloggers with game trainers and browser plugins.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.50.75" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.50.75">173.245.50.75</a> 18:14, 2 July 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Lorrie Faith Cranor gets the random part of #936 word generation correct, which is great. Regarding memorizability, this study (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2012/proceedings/a7_Shay.pdf">https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2012/proceedings/a7_Shay.pdf</a>) does not address #936. The study uses no generator for gibberish of length 11. Most comparable are perhaps two classes of five or six randomly assigned characters. None of the study's generators has 44 bits of entropy – its dictionary for the method closest to #936 – noun-instr – contains only 181 nouns. The article contains no discussion of the significance of these differences to #936. In her TED Lorrie Faith Cranor says ”sorry all you xkcd fans” which could be interpreted as judgement of #936, but there is no basis in the above article for that. It does however seem plausible that the report could be reworked to address #936. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Gnirre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gnirre (page does not exist)">Gnirre</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gnirre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gnirre (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:42, 14 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Password-changing frequency isn't about making passwords more <i>secure</i>, but instead it's about <i>mitigating the damage</i> of a successfully cracked password. If a hacker gets your password (through any means) and your password changes every 90 days, the password the hacker has obtained is only useful for a few months at most. That might be enough, but it might not. If the hacker is brute forcing the passwords to get them, that cuts into the time the password is useful. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.168" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.168">173.245.54.168</a> 22:22, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>However, brute-forcing gets much <i>easier</i> that way.</dd>
<dd>Say the average employee is around for 10 years, which is reasonable for some companies , absurdly high for others, and a bit low for a family business. That's 40 password changes.</dd>
<dd>Now if you have to remember another password every now and then, you sacrifice complexity, lest you forget it. A factor of 40 is like one character less. But how much shorter will the password be? It's more likely that it's gonna be 3 or 4 characters less. Congrats, you just a factor of 1000's for a perceived "mitigation", which doesn't even work. Pro attackers can vacuum your server in a DAY once they have the PW. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.53" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.53">141.101.104.53</a> 13:03, 4 December 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Just because you are required to have a password that has letters and numbers in it doesn't mean you can't make it memorable.  When caps are required, use CamelCase.  When punctuation is required, make it an ampersand (&amp;) or include a contraction.  When numbers are required, pick something that has significance to you (your birthday, the resolution of your television, ect.).  Keep in mind that, if your phrase is an actual sentence, the password entropy is 1.1 bits per character (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/34">http://what-if.xkcd.com/34</a>), so length is key if you want your password to be secure. (Though no known algorithm can actually exploit the 1.1 bits of entropy to gain time, so it might be more like 11 bits of entropy per word.  Even then, my passwords have nonexistent and uncommon words in them, (like doge or trope), which also adds some entropy.)   <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.213" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.213">108.162.246.213</a> 22:18, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Flip side of the story, the "capital plus small plus other char" policy doesn't make your password any safer.</dd>
<dd>The German company T-online had an experimental gateway with the password, "internet". Now that sucked. No problem, tho, because that gateway wasn't accessible from outside. When they went live, they "improved" the password to "Internet1". There are still lots of these passwords around: first letter is a Cap, and the only non-alphabetic char is a 1 at the end. This doesn't add any entropy. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.53" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.53">141.101.104.53</a> 13:03, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That's a good idea; it adds to the entropy bits per word. If you really want to throw them off, mix different languages.

<p>Also, passwords that are 'hard to remember' are themselves a security vulnerability. A password reset scheme (or even a lockout scheme) is a vulnerability. The more it needs to be used, the harder it becomes to police that vulnerability. Relatedly, hard-to-remember passwords leave users uncertain whether their password has been changed by someone else or they've just forgotten it. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ijkcomputer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ijkcomputer (page does not exist)">Ijkcomputer</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ijkcomputer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ijkcomputer (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:32, 18 December 2014 (UTC)

</p><p>I have not read all of the replies and in truth most of the detail is boring to me but it has occurred to me that with this sort of problem and since the Snowden affair, serious security devices will have to make the keyboard redundant. 
</p><p>At the moment all I can imagine is a series of pictures like hieroglyphs but even using a rolling code of ever changing font glyphs would do. When the security required by money minders reaches the stage of development possible with keyboards that can supply that sort of security, we will have some idea which banks have some idea about security.

Not Barings. They have an history of intransigence and stupidity. (Still revered in banks though as able to cure colon cancer with poor investment strategies.)

The D0g..................... (24 characters long) is NOT stronger than PrXyc.N(n4k77#L!eVdAfp9 (23 characters long). The reason why, is that the later password is random. There is no pattern. The former, "padding" technique can  be very easily cracked. You just need to assume that each character be repeated 1~30 times. Then the first password would become&#160;: 1(D)1(0)1(g)21(.), which, is then of complexity 30^4 + 96^4, versus 96^23 for the random password. And that is assuming that any character can be repeated 1~30 times, so DDDDDDDDD0000000ggggggg...... also would be cracked extremely quickly. If you limit yourself to only last character padding, your password now becomes 30*96^4 possibilities.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.222.235" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.222.235">108.162.222.235</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.222.235&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.222.235 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

And that's why it is stupid to explain this kind of joke&#160;: it depends on many (MANY) parameters such as brute-force method and encryption/hash algorithm. Giving this kind of (wrong) explanations about "pass cracking" (as if it was always the same way to process ...) is ridiculous. And they talk about entropy .......... Holy shit, go back to school and stop screwing cryptography up. zM_

I'am astonished that even someone like Schneier don't get 936 right immediately after reading it. So, I think I know what was going on in Munroes mind conceptually. Maybe there are some grans of salt, but I don't have a problem with these. But I do have one (or two) quantitative problem(s) with 936:
</p>
<ul><li> I was not able to find out, how Munroe get the value of about 16 bits of entropy for the "uncommon" nine letter lower case "non-gibberish base word". This would mean: On average, a letter of such a word will have about 1.8 bits of entropy. May be, but how do we know? "Citation needed!"&#160;;-)</li>
<li> (Secondly: The "punctuation" should have 5, not 4 bits of entropy. There are 32 (2^5) ASCII punctuation characters (POSIX class [:punct:]). But I assume this is a lapse.)</li></ul>
<p>Can someone enlighten me? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.91.236" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.91.236">162.158.91.236</a> 17:31, 19 September 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I have missed the sentence "Randall assumes only the 16 most common characters are used in practice (4 bits)". Hm. There is a huge list with real world passwords out there, leaking from RockYou in 2009. After some processing to remove passwords containing characters that are not printable ASCII characters (ñ, £, ๅ, NBSP, EOT, ...), the list contains about 14329849 unique passwords from about 32585010 accounts (there are some garbage "passwords" like HTML code fragments).

<dl><dd>Sorry, I have no "citation". But you can play with the leaked RockYou password list yourself. Here is a way to reach that playground:</dd></dl>
<pre>$ # Download the compressed list (57 MiB; I have no idea what "skullsecurity"
$ # is, it was simply the first find and I assume it's the said list):
$ wget http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou-withcount.txt.bz2

$ # Decompress the list (243 MiB), or, to speak more exact, it's a table:
$ bzip2 -dk rockyou-withcount.txt.bz2

$ # The content of the table is: "How many accounts (first row) were using that
$ # password (second row)?" Let's take a peek:
$ head -n5 rockyou-withcount.txt
 290729 123456
  79076 12345
  76789 123456789

$ # The following command processes the table to remove lines with passwords
$ # containing characters that are not printable ASCII characters (14541
$ # lines/passwords, 18038 accounts), and lines insisting that there were some
$ # accounts with no password (1 line, 340 accounts). Moreover, the command
$ # removes every space character not belonging to a password, makes the rows
$ # tab-delimited and writes the result in a file called "ry" (161 MiB; many
$ # bloating spaces removed).
$ LC_ALL=C sed -n 's/^ *\([1-9][0-9]*\) \([[:print:]]\{1,\}\)$/\1\t\2/p' rockyou-withcount.txt &gt;ry

$ # The following are shell functions to build commands. They will be explained

<dl><dt>You've Already Memorized It</dt></dl>
<p>Originally I logged in to report a local xkcd related phenomenon, and ask if anyone else had experienced it. The destiny, seemingly inescapable, that at once became my own upon seeing that last panel; the effect of the self-fullfilling combination of the very specific look of inquiry -- one I recognize immediately and associate with the words <i>"interesting, Captain"</i> -- and the insidiously performative <i>"You've already memorized it."</i> At first I doubted this was actually the case, but soon I could no longer, since not only did the phrase readily come to the mind and out the mouth, it also came up often.  The <i>"correct"</i> soon replaced the word <i>"right"</i> in everyday conversation, then <i>"right you are"</i> and <i>"yes"</i> and so forth, then its opposite (with a <i>"no"</i> in front), then replacing the direction, the verb involving pen and paper (the most recent development was merely a quick under the breath aside of an acronym of the remaining words).  All followed by the rest of the absurdly perfect password. <b>Now here's the kicker: I logged on to tell you all this for some reason, only to find, I had memorized <i>"correct horse staple battery"</i> instead of <i>"correct horse battery staple."</i></b><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:A_female_faust&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:A female faust (page does not exist)">A female faust</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:A_female_faust&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:A female faust (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:58, 31 July 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>Would you believe it, the guy who made the bad password rules switched his philosophy to this comic's: "Long, easy-to-remember phrases now get the nod over crazy characters" "In a widely circulated piece, cartoonist <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall_Munroe" title="Randall Munroe">Randall Munroe</a> calculated it would take 550 years to crack the password “correct horse battery staple,” all written as one word. The password Tr0ub4dor&amp;3—a typical example of a password using Mr. Burr’s old rules—could be cracked in three days" <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Jacky720" title="User:Jacky720">That's right, Jacky720 just signed this</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Jacky720" title="User talk:Jacky720">talk</a> | <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Jacky720" title="Special:Contributions/Jacky720">contribs</a>) 11:57, 8 August 2017 (UTC)
</p><p>The 44 bits of entropy breaks down rapidly when you realize in real life, most people will choose a passphrase that contains words like "pass", "phrase", "remember", "long", "company" and quite likely "stupid". It's the passphrase equivalent of "password123". If the words are selected randomly and then assigned to a person, that would fix that problem (but create others, like mistrust of a computer that assigns passwords for you to log into that same computer with). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nerfer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nerfer (page does not exist)">Nerfer</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nerfer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nerfer (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:19, 11 October 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>There is one aspect which has been left out the whole time. I do not question things like wordlist length, entropy, or substitutions. However, doing shoulder surfing will either reveal a full password or in parts. A full password should not be topic of discussion. In the case of partial success, it is in the proposed method far easier to guess the rest of the password than in the traditional one. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:CommingFromTheSide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CommingFromTheSide (page does not exist)">CommingFromTheSide</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:CommingFromTheSide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:CommingFromTheSide (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:16, 5 November 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>As for "author's 28 bits mistake". I believe that Randall does mean the common lexicon with mangling substitutions. That means that counterexample "J4I/tyJ&amp;Acy" does have 72bits, but nonetheless is irrelevant to character/personage strategy of choosing a memorable yet strong password. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.215.113" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.215.113">172.68.215.113</a> 13:17, 23 February 2020 (UTC)

Ah... this reminds me of one of my old password.
