<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation#Modern_staff_notation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Musical notation">standard Western musical notation</a>, the horizontal position of a note indicates its relative temporal position in the piece, and the vertical position of a note denotes  its pitch; but the pitch is really a logarithm of the note's frequency (every octave/seven named notes/12 semitones/13 named notes including accidentals equals a doubling of frequency), so it's a semi-log plot of sorts.  The comic thus explores what a notation would look like if the horizontal axis behaved this way instead. Likewise, the vertical axis has been rendered linearly by frequency, with the normally equally-set lines on a normal musical staff stretching to compensate for the increasing jumps between pitches.

<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> may have mistakenly assumed that the lines of a music stave represent a linear increase in pitch and thus an exponential increase in frequency. He has thus mapped them onto a logarithmic scale by doubling the space between each successive line of the stave - one space between the bottom two lines, then two spaces, then four, then eight. In fact, the lines and the spaces between them correspond to notes in the C Major scale, which have unequal gaps between them. It is also possible that he is aware of this small inaccuracy and chose to ignore it in the name of humor.
</p><p>The title text purports to explain how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Hall_of_the_Mountain_King" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:In the Hall of the Mountain King">In the Hall of the Mountain King</a>, which progressively increases in tempo/speed and intensity from an initially subtle start into a rapid hustle towards a series of crescendos at the end, was written on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%E2%80%93log_plot" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Log–log plot">log-log paper</a>, that features nonlinear expansion in <i>both</i> its axes (in order to render various exponential graphs linear, often for the purposes of ease of understanding). Rather than these features being a deliberate composition decision, this says that they're only the result of how it was written down, or thenceforth read. The accident would have to be that music was originally written <i>as though</i> for log-log paper, using shorter notes as the piece went on, intended to have consistent actual durations throughout the piece—and then <i>interpreted</i> on a linear time scale, such that the later notes actually had shorter durations, speeding up the piece.

<dl><dd>(It's server time. Which is set as UTC. Currently matches central European summer time, I guess, but is one hour behind me (using BST in ordinary life), but matches me nicely when I'm back on GMT. If I read you right, I'm guessing you're on the US east-coast TZ (or equivalent, elsewhere in the Americas), and if you're on DST right now you'll find you have to mentally adjust by <i>five</i> whenever you're not. I imagine that logged-in people can configure dynamic time displays to local time (for themselves), but 'hard written records like on these signatures probably aren't converted 'live' (no good way to not mess up with false-changes/false-nonchanges) so there's probably no point doing that anyway. Just realise that you need to remember that it's an offset of four/five/whatever-it-might-be for your current time and place and rejoice that (with a spherical Earth, not somehow unified under one global political system that can tell all people to work with ever stranger hours of daylight, therefore with necessarily disjointed timezones) at least there's no possibility of falling off the 'edge' and perhaps into the jaws of the world-serpent. There are plenty of other problems, but not that! ...and no doubt there was discussion as to whether to align with Randall's habitual locale, instead, but more people know how to convert between their local UTC±whatever and straight UTC (or don't have to) than might be expected to reliably cross convert between two different ± values, correctly and accounting for whether either or both are DST at the moment. So I don't just say I'm happy with the situation because (for half a year) it matches my own TZ, I think it's just best all round. And doubtless various Europeans think so too (especially the other half of the year!). With apologies to Kiwis, Hawaiians and everyone else for the minor (but predictable) time-shifts they pretty kuch always have to consider, but still would even if you were happily aligned by circumstance...&#160;;) ) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.220" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.220">141.101.98.220</a> 09:42, 13 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>The UTC times are usually 4 hours ahead of me, and I'm Eastern, the first North American time zone, same as New York City and Miami (i.e. now it's just past midnight, on the West coast of North America it's just past 9pm). Usually I find my friends in U.K. are 5 hours away from me (and my time zone is always listed as -5), my family in Europe tend to be 6, but I think that changes with Daylight Savings (we ALMOST got rid of the stupid useless Daylight Savings last year, I'm hoping for this year). UTC always seems to resolve to the middle of the ocean, I always wonder why UTC exists at all, why not go with Greenwich Mean Time in such cases??? So, yeah, the "last edit" was probably just before your comment, and you're in the same time zone as me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:NiceGuy1" title="User:NiceGuy1">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:NiceGuy1" title="User talk:NiceGuy1">talk</a>) 04:22, 17 June 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>UTC==GMT (for all practical purposes), i.e. Greenwich-zeroed, straight down the Prime Meridian (solar time) and UK-wide time when not we're not on BST==UTC+1. East Coast US is 5 hours from us, <i>except</i> for the week or three when either the entry or the exit from DST (I forget which one, but it <i>is</i> just the one or other) is not the same weekend for both UK and US, so we're disjointed by an hour (I think it reduces to 4 hours, but it's been a while since I needed to know that to avoid disturbing anyone's sleep/lunch). However, UTC definitely isn't in the ocean (well, not the main bits) like you seem to say. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.169" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.169">172.70.85.169</a> 05:25, 17 June 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>No, UTC=/=GMT, they're an hour apart, usually. Whenever I check. That's why it doesn't make sense. I'm not sure if it cuts into the western part of Africa, but if not that entire time zone is ocean (which may be the point, to not favour anybody). GMT, a.k.a. the time in England, is 5 hours from me, time for my friends in England are 5 hours ahead of me in Eastern, and any time I have to set my time zone it's listed as "GMT -5", usually along with one of the major cities in this time zone (like New York, Miami, Montreal, Toronto). UTC is 4, as proven by my 22 minutes past midnight comment being marked as 4:22am. EVERY time I check where 4 hours is, it's the middle of the ocean. Since it sounds like you're in the GMT zone, did you not comment at 6:25am? Two things are for sure: I'm "GMT -5" and UTC is +4 for me, making it GMT -1. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:NiceGuy1" title="User:NiceGuy1">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:NiceGuy1" title="User talk:NiceGuy1">talk</a>) 06:05, 17 June 2023 (UTC)

I <i>would</i> be in GMT zone but (like your other friends, here) I'm technically in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:British Summer Time">British Summer Time</a> right now, which is +1 to either of those two. I commented then at 5:25 GMT/UTC, but it was actually 6:25 BST. Midnight+22 minutes in your timezone is 4:22am UTC/GMT right now(/then). Because whilevyou are UTC-5 for half the year, you are UTC-4 right now with DST shifting <i>you</i> Eastwards, into the ocean, effectively, like it shoves me 'eastwards' (into the time that Paris/etc would have, if it wasn't for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Central European Time">Central European Time</a> places now being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Central European Summer Time">Central European Summer Time</a> at +2...).
<dl><dd> See my reply below,&#160;:) Though I thought GMT was simply the name for the time zone in England. My time zone being officially GMT -5 and UTC being GMT -1 by comparison seems to say you're incorrect? I swear, every country needs to just drop this Daylight Savings crap, it just causes confusion, it serves no practical purpose. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:NiceGuy1" title="User:NiceGuy1">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:NiceGuy1" title="User talk:NiceGuy1">talk</a>) 05:20, 18 June 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Your mistake is in believing that GMT is <i>ever</i> anything other than UTC+0. And it's not DST causing confusion, because GMT never includes any DST adjustment. That's what BST is for. c.f. your(?) own EST and EDT. "London time" (or "UK..."/"English..." or whatever region/town you wish to label) varies by moving between +0 and +1 offsets on top of UTC/GMT, identically.</dd>
<dd> The complaints about DST (in my country and yours) are well known, but different issues. Indeed, some people would prefer that we do one last "spring on" one year but then never "fall back" again. Then Greenwich (the place) <i>might</i> never again be at UTC, but I suspect that GMT will remain equivalent to UTC but now we'd be on British Standard Time (UTC+1/GMT+1) all year, rather than British Summer Time (likewise) for only about half of it.</dd>
<dd> Or there are those who always wanted to just miss <i>one</i> 'fall back' to then align ourselves with CET/CEDT of the large swathe of Central Europe (and most places that we would cross the Channel/North Sea/Bay Of Biscay to reach), but that doesn't remove DST and as for moving towards Germany/France/etc, I suspect people would either hate that or find it now pointless since the B-word was initiated. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.242.83" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.242.83">172.71.242.83</a> 21:34, 20 June 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd> No mistake, I'm right. EST is GMT -5, UTC -4. I don't BELIEVE this to be true, I see it on this website, I see it everywhere I have to select my time zone. These numbers are not the same. Do they look the same to you? Otherwise, this website has always misrepresented UTC as one hour earlier than it is (this website is my main source of knowing what/when UTC is), since I joined like 6 or more years ago. My midnight comment then (and it is almost 12:30 now) was labelled 4am, this one should be 4:30. These times are 5 and 5:30 in England, whenever I see what time it is in England. EVERY collection/setting of time zone labels this time zone as GMT -5. How does 4am minus 12am equal 5? Anyone in England, try pretending you're changing your computer/device's time zone to New York City or Miami, see how it says it's GNT -5. Instead of trying to call me wrong or claiming that UTC and GMT is the same, try explaining this discrepancy. And proving it like I have.&#160;;) <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:NiceGuy1" title="User:NiceGuy1">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:NiceGuy1" title="User talk:NiceGuy1">talk</a>) 04:36, 24 June 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Can't account for anyone who has (mis-)programmed your system to perhaps call "London(/Dublin/Lisbon) Time" GMT, even when said time is shifted to BST(/equiv), which might cause you some confusion. <i>Or</i> where said system specifies what TZ it is (normally) talking about by the non-DST standard name (GMT, EST) then 'silently' making the system time go +1 to that (BST, EDT) when the "Use Daylight Savings Time" checkbox is both active <i>and</i> chronologically applicable.</dd>

<dl><dd> No, my system is correctly programmed (as is EVERYONE'S, including yours, talk to Microsoft). Ever since at least Windows 95 (I don't think Windows 3.11 and before had a timezone setting), my timezone has been listed as GMT -5. Same with anything besides Windows which has a timezone setting. I am 5 timezones away from GMT, always have been, but my comments on here get FOUR hours added to get to UTC. 4 hours from me is all ocean, as I initially said. This is confirmed by most things listing this timezone as "GMT -5: New York", "GMT -5: Miami", Toronto, Montreal... I am finding it very disappointing that multiple times I've offered/challenged a self-check, to look at the time zones on your own computers/devices, and nobody - of PEOPLE ON <b>THIS</b> SITE of all places - has ANY scientific curiosity to even LOOK!

<dl><dd> Ah, but if you take the stance of "Daylight Savings is crap", from that viewpoint it's summer that the time is correct and proper, what would be the official time for each timezone. Meaning OFFICIALLY, GMT is an hour ahead of UTC.&#160;:) It's just during winter it happens to sync up (since presumably UTC does not observe Daylight Savings Time). DST is designed for winter, to adjust the daylight to more compatible hours during the winter, to save candle usage (shows how irrelevant and out of date this practice is), the winter time is the one that would be ditched if all the countries got their acts together and dismissed this DST silliness. When the practice is dropped, GMT will be permanently an hour ahead of UTC. Hence my comments of UTC being in the middle of the ocean.&#160;:) Last year when the countries were discussing it, the plan was to just not do the Fall Back last November and stay on summer time. Also, I can't check in 6 months because hopefully by then this nonsense will be abolished. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:NiceGuy1" title="User:NiceGuy1">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:NiceGuy1" title="User talk:NiceGuy1">talk</a>) 05:09, 18 June 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>You're using the wrong changes. For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Eastern Time Zone">Eastern Time Zone</a>, EST is UTC-5/GMT-5.

It seems you're mixing up what you think is being compared to what.</dd>
<dd><i><sup>*</sup> - when applicable. It turns out I was slightly wrong about one thing. GMT becomes BST at 01:00GMT on the last Sunday in March, with EST becoming EDT having changed already on the second Sunday in March (typically two weeks earlier, but depends upon the number of Sundays that cram into the month) </i>and<i> BST-&gt;GMT happens on the last Sunday of October whilst EDT-&gt;EST on first Sunday in November (one week apart, regardless).</i></dd>
<dd><i>Unless things have changed since I thought one end matched the other, I was incorrect about having to only track the "different difference" between me and my transatlantic colleagues once a year (also those on the Pacific-coast at 8hrs±dif, but Japanese contacts were so far adrift it didn't really matter and Europe-wide we were already in synch as far as DST shifts), but for three (or four) weeks a year, I'd have to deal with GMT-&gt;EDT conversions (4 hours difference, and I think 7 for the likes of San Diego) when deciding when to schedule an afternoon teleconference that wasn't quite so inconveniently early in the morning for them but still meant I didn't have to stick around too far into the evening. - ...end of overlyextended footnote!</i></dd>

<dl><dd> WHY would I play with that Uruguay Time Zone tool when my time and timezone are already correct???!? LMAO! That seems like it's meant to change when the computer applies DST, but Microsoft already did that in an update back then. If they missed Uruguay, maybe because Uruguay changed the date some year before North America did, I'd guess Microsoft caught up by now. It's been built into Windows since. The reason you're finding broken links is because the whole concept is outdated and no longer necessary. The problem is, you keep treating me as mistaken when I haven't been. I am GMT -5. I've said that all along, and a couple of times you've told ME, as if I didn't already say it first. At least you seem to FINALLY accept that I'm GMT -5.</dd>
<dd> What <i><b>_I_</b></i> want to know now is WHY summer time is known as DST when the entire concept is designed for the WINTER, to adjust the time on the clock to favour daylight while daylight is shorter. It should be winter that's the adjusted time and called DST (making me GST -6 in the winter I guess)... Also, if UTC is another term for GMT, why does it even exist? I'm sure UTC is extremely newer, I never heard of it until I came to this site 5 or 6 years ago. What's wrong with having the site label things as GMT?

<p>...you're a nice guy, NiceGuy1, but at this point I think you're being obtuse. Right now you're running at GMT-5 and in the mainland US then you're in the Central Daylight Time area. And winter is 'natural' time, or as natural as your nation decides it needs to be (c.f. China) to follow the Sun. But the daylight being saved in summer is that daylight between dawn and the time anybody but early-risers will eventually appreciate it. That time is saved, and applied to the end of the day when anybody but an abnormally early-retirer will probably make better use of it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.79.146" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.79.146">172.69.79.146</a> 23:02, 1 July 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I am NOT Central, I am Eastern, as I've said multiple times, funny how it's the one who's been obtuse all along calling ME obtuse. I'm not the one continuously showing unwillingness to check anything (maybe if you did you'd finally grasp how I'm in the Eastern time zone - whatever the hell they call it this time of year). All I've done is mention two facts that call into question this "UTC=GMT" claim, that my timezone is always labelled "GMT -5" - all year round - and my comments on here get four hours added to reach UTC (it's now about 11:20pm, so I expect this to say 3:20 UTC). And here's a third: If they're the same, why invent the term? GMT is clearly older, and has a location in the name to help people place it, the term is superior in every way. Someone said there's a marginal difference, but that seems foolish and NOT worth a new term.</dd>
<dd>Basically, it seems clear they ARE supposed to be the same, fine, I'm just asking for a resolution to these facts and have received none, really. Combined with sensing immense confusion from you has been frustrating when it seems like I, for one, have been clear all along. Oh, and I think I already said, the only function of Daylight Savings Time has always been to save candles in the winter, align the working day more with daylight hours to minimize how much/long candles are needed in the morning. In the WINTER, when hours are short enough for people to wake up when it's still dark, meaning the "correct" time is summer. Candles, shows how out of date the concept is and how long this has been irrelevant and should have been retired.</dd>

See which ones name New York, Miami, Toronto, Montreal? See how they're GMT -5?). You just confirmed #5 yourself. And funny, you provide a link to call me wrong without reading it and seeing it confirms what I said: "The idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in 1784 by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin.". Saving candles, as I said. And it's only in the winter that the sun tends to rise AFTER the average person, the only time people might need more light by which to get ready and started in the morning.

<dl><dd>Understanding failures:
<ol><li> From link on Eastern Time Zone (that you read?) "Eastern <u>Daylight</u> Time (EDT), when observing daylight saving time (spring/summer), are <u>four hours</u> behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−04:00)." Which is also GMT-4 (see link about GMT, which you also read?)).</li>
<li> ...see point 1.</li>
<li> <a href="/wiki/index.php/927:_Standards" title="927: Standards">927: Standards</a> (Note also terminology such as "Zulu Time", for the same thing by yet <i>another</i> name.) Ok, so technically there's also differences in the treatment of natural astronomical drift, regarding "leap seconds" and any other necessary adjustments. Not that this really effects what time you get up in the morning, to any noticable degree.</li>
<li> It may have been candles for Franklin, but that (different implementation) was never actually practiced. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Willett" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:William Willett">William Willett</a>, it may really have been <i>golf</i> that drove his suggestion. When it was actually implemented (German states, WW1), it was coal, and it has been more vaguely energy in general since. <i>Buf</i> social reasons in general probably dominate, these days (longer summer evenings by borrowing from the unused longer summer mornings that few 'normal' people would bother get up earlier for <i>without</i> everything from school opening times to the TV schedule being shifted en-mass in 'summer'...)</li>
<li> It varies in description, depending on system, but if I look at the one that'd clearly be most confusing to you (to best echo what you're seeing/perceiving) I'm in GMT Time Zone (the zone which is based upon GMT±0) with a further tickbox that makes Daylight Savings adjustment active for half the year. Thus, right now, I am running on BST, which is both UTC+1 and GMT+1. But I do not (cannot) select BST. And to choose a (non-DST adjusted) GMT+1 TZ would be 'synchronous' but technically wrong. And would require me to manually relocalise myself again when other clocks return to normal. For this reason, your system probably also (to your confusion) applies +1 for DST <i>on top of</i> being GMT-5 (and UTC-5) to currently be GMT-4 (as well as UTC-4) without your additional intervention.</li></ol>
<ul><li>...you abandon your point-by-poing ramble, so I am now forced to.)</li></ul></dd>
<dd>There's no way to get more daylight than the day provides, so Winter (when there's less of it) reverts to 'natural' time and you 'gain' in the mornings by <i>not</i> lending daylight to the evening. But you (and your 'candles') are no longer being helped, so the eventually darker mornings (and suddenly much darker evenings) are now unavoidable to everyone who considers themselves a willing slave to the (re-unadjusted) clock. Either accept the shorter periods of light or 'burn the candle(s) at both ends'.</dd>
<dd>You said "the only function of Daylight Savings Time has always been to save candles in the winter" ...which I'm sure you now realise is wrong, right? (To be clear,l: DST does not happen in 'winter', but 'summer'. And "only" is somewhat inaccurate, even ignoring that main error.)</dd>

The one glaring discrepancy is that on a true linear scale, the note E5 (659 Hz) would be closer to F5 (698 Hz) than to D5 (587 Hz). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Rick4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rick4 (page does not exist)">Rick4</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Rick4&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Rick4 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:29, 13 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Most sheet music is not truly linear in time to begin with. It's pseudo-logarithmic but in the sense that the shorter notes (8ths and 16ths and heaven forbid 32nds for us da**ed drummers) are given MORE space relative to the (fixed) size of the note heads compared to quarter, half, and full notes. This then affects the on-page length of measures: measures with faster notes are longer (as measurable with a small ruler) than those with longer/slower notes, even though -- assuming a fixed tempo -- their play speed (time duration) stays the same. And then you get modifiers like "rit(ardando)", "rall(entando)", "accel(erando)", "piu mosso", "meno mosso", and the like which modify tempo and throw the whole page-space-to-time relation out the window as if the page of sheet music itself (or the audience) sped to near-light speeds. Randall's going off the deep end trying to make this insane notation fit into fixed science rules; best to leave it to us crazy musicians and just enjoy the music. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.65.46" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.65.46">172.69.65.46</a> 10:44, 13 June 2023 (UTC)
</p><p>"Randall seems to have mistakenly assumed" what? no, the entire point of the comic is that Randall knows standard staves do *not* represent a linear increase in frequency. A treble clef is centered on G4, which has a frequency of 392 Hz, F4 has a frequency of 349, and E4 has a frequency of 330. The drawn stave has one line between E4 and F4, corresponding to a jump of about 19 Hz. Two lines between F4 and G4, and we're assuming a linear scale, so that's about right to get to 392. The size of the games grows geometrically, as you expect. Again, this is the entire point of the comic.
</p>
<dl><dd>That's not what it says, though. It says he may have assumed it's a linear increase in *pitch*, and therefore a *exponential* increase in frequency.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.86.2" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.86.2">172.70.86.2</a> 08:40, 14 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>is that not correct? Doesn't an equal temperament scale exactly mean that it is a linear increase in pitch? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.114.240" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.114.240">172.70.114.240</a> 16:11, 14 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>An equal temperament scale means there's a linear increase in pitch by half-step/semitone, correct. However, any Western scale or mode regardless of quality will only include 7 notes, while there are 13 when including accidentals; the quality is determined by which notes are adjacent or separated by an accidental, or in other words if they are separated by one half-step or two. *However*, since standard notation uses other symbols to indicate deviation from the expected frequency and not separate lines, I'd argue that such would be the approach taken in a world where this sheet music was used. Therefore, I'd say this whole paragraph is unnecessary and misguided. Randall is taking a standard piece of sheet music and warping the scales of the axes, nothing more. He's not trying to make a valid, coherent new system of notation, he's making a graph joke. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.159.125" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.159.125">162.158.159.125</a> 17:27, 14 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>But the point is that not only is his 'mistake' version 'wrong' (non-standard), but his remedy would result in notation that was 'wrong' as well, on both 'axes'.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.49" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.49">172.70.85.49</a> 08:37, 15 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I'm not following. Don't the lines in a staff indicate equal spaced whole steps (between consecutive lines) or half-steps (between lines and spaces)? What is the "mistake" that randall is alleged to have made, and have we agreed that it is infact a mistake or not? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.158.58" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.158.58">162.158.158.58</a> 04:01, 17 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>They do not. Each line in a staff is either a half step or whole step above the space below it, depending on the key. For example, C major has the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B with no sharps or flats. Each one gets a line or a space between lines on the staff. But the interval between C and D is a whole step, while the interval between E and F is a half step. In equal temperament tuning, every half step has the same ratio, so the ratio in a full step is its square. On a log plot, that would mean the full steps would be twice as wide as the half steps, but they are in fact the same width. It gets even more complicated when you consider accidentals. For instance, D and D♭ are a half step apart but occupy the same line. Meanwhile, B and C♭ are enharmonically equivalent (i.e. the same pitch in equal temperament tuning), but they occupy different parts of the staff. And of course, double accidentals just make things worse. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:EebstertheGreat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EebstertheGreat (page does not exist)">EebstertheGreat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:EebstertheGreat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:EebstertheGreat (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:12, 17 June 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
