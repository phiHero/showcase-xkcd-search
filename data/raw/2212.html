<p>This comic pokes fun at the ever-increasing function of smartphones and their users' reliance on them through an unusual horizontal bar graph showing what services a smartphone provides (or will provide) that were performed by other devices in the past and when the switch took or will take place. It starts sensibly: Calling, browsing the Internet, and taking pictures are the most prominent examples of tasks that many if not most people use a smartphone instead of a specific device nowadays. The next item, newspaper, extends the Internet's capabilities (either from within the mobile browser or as a dedicated app), and the next, flashlight, repurposes the phone camera's flash unit; both are now commonplace features of smartphones. Some people even use their smartphone as the remote for their TV (either via RF wireless [e.g., WiFi] for smart TVs, or via their phone's infrared port) or to pay in stores using payment providers like Google Play Wallet, Samsung Pay, or Apple Pay, which utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Near-field communication">near-field communication</a> functionality of modern smartphones. A few cars now support using a phone app instead of a key fob, rendering yet another item obsolete; apparently, Randall just started using this feature in his car, as this item is in the very recent past in the comic's diagram.
</p><p>Then the comic drifts off into smartphone capabilities either not yet possible or likely never to be possible. These capabilities are right of the "now" mark, meaning Randall has not switched to using a smartphone for them: One cannot currently use a phone app as a dog leash, nor as an adhesive bandage. While using a phone as a steering wheel is possible (likely interfacing with the car's self-driving features), it would be a reversal of current initiatives to prevent drivers from using cell phones while driving. Things get increasingly odd, to the point where a smartphone is allegedly used as a toothbrush. Several items would require physical changes to the phone and not just repurposing existing capabilities, such as operating as a cheese grater, stapler or nail clipper, which would make the phone look and feel more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_Knife" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Swiss Army Knife">Swiss Army Knife</a> instead.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> 
</p><p>The title text continues this path by continuing the list of objects his phone will supposedly replace. These include a "tazer" (a misspelling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Taser">taser</a>), a fire extinguisher, a bird feeder, and toilet paper, continuing the path of absurdity the comic implies with its supposed future uses for a phone.

<table class="wikitable">

<tr>
<th> Function
</th>
<th> Possible way a phone could be used
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> Dog leash
</td>
<td> While this could be a physical leash that spools out of the phone, it would more likely be some kind of an electronic leash, which would activate an electronic dog collar which would somehow (mild shock? vibration? ultrasonic or audible sound?) alert and/or stop the dog when it gets too far from the phone.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Steering wheel
</td>
<td> This could entail rotating the phone in the same manner as one rotates a steering wheel, it could involve dragging your finger on the screen on a picture of a steering wheel, or, less literally, it could be more along the lines of a self-driving car where you use the phone to designate a destination, and the phone (or car) would steer the car automatically to get there. A phone that can steer a car was featured as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_gadgets" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of James Bond gadgets">James Bond gadget</a> in the film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Dies" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tomorrow Never Dies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></i>.  Or simply, a lot of remote-controlled drones/cars are steered by a smartphone nowadays, it is just not as common as other smartphone functions because of a lesser market it has.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-Aid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Band-Aid">Band-Aid</a>
</td>
<td> As a way to cover wounds, it could dispense physical adhesive strips, such as Band-Aid brand strips.  It might also contain a liquid or gel that would harden over a wound to seal it.  It's unlikely this could be done without some physical substance which would need to be replenished sometime after use unless Randall widened the definition of Band-Aid to include devices such as dermal regenerators featured in Star Trek.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_grater" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cheese grater">Cheese grater</a>
</td>
<td> This would be relatively easy but impractical, adding bulk to the phone and risking accidentally grating or slicing substances other than cheese, such as your hand or your pocket.  You might also get cheese particles in the phone; a waterproof or water-resistant phone might be okay, but those ratings generally do not test for cheese dust.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> This may be a reference to Homer’s personal organizer having a cheese grater in the Simpsons episode <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Brother%27s_Little_Helper/Quotes">Brother’s Little Helper</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Stapler
</td>
<td> This would again add bulk and require replenishing of supplies, and where the phone is presumably helping to eliminate paper, this would work counter to that goal as it would only be useful in the presence of paper.  Some "stapling" techniques do not involve actual staples; they work by cutting and folding little bits of paper so a few sheets hang together.  This would eliminate bulk and the need to store pieces of metal but would be limited to very short stacks of just a few sheets of paper.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Nail clipper
</td>
<td> This might not be too hard or add too much bulk, but it's just one more of potentially hundreds or thousands of little things that could be added but aren't justified based on how single-purpose the function is.  Maybe as a general-purpose cutter/scissors?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Electric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Drill">drill</a>
</td>
<td> More bulk, and it would be a real power drain for the batteries.  Maybe that's why it's further into the future, as it probably depends on better battery technology.  Many phones already have a built-in motor that rotates, purposely off-balance and meant to cause vibrations (for tactile notifications, especially when sound is turned off).  Perhaps that could be made more powerful and given a center hole that can take a bit?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Toothbrush
</td>
<td> More bulk, and while useful it probably isn't useful enough to justify adding it to the phone. The phone should probably also dispense toothpaste, otherwise, the toothbrush doesn't accomplish the goal of letting the phone completely replace the needed items for a particular function (brushing teeth in this case).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Taser">Taser</a> (misspelled as <i>tazer</i> in the title text)
</td>
<td> A Taser is a brand of "conducted electrical weapon", typically used as a "less-lethal" weapon by law enforcement. Commercial Tasers are also marketed for the general public for self-defense purposes. With the battery power available for a functional electric drill, a Taser may not be far behind. A Taser as a phone feature is not currently available, but other stun gun-type phone cases are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=taser+phone+attachment">already on the market</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fire extinguisher">Fire extinguisher</a>
</td>
<td> While this might entail having to stock fire-controlling substances (water, Freon, powders, etc.), it's unlikely a phone could contain enough to do anything substantial against a fire.  Perhaps there is a future and as yet unknown role for sound or light emissions in the combating of fires?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeder" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bird feeder">Bird feeder</a>
</td>
<td> A phone could contain some seeds or bird food which could be dispensed, but most people would not want a bunch of birds too near their phone, especially pooping on it.  Again, not very practical for the space those seeds would take, and it would need frequent refilling.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Toilet paper">Toilet paper</a>
</td>
<td> Definitely not... unless maybe those fictitious sound waves or vibrations or light could be used to "shake" the poop or dirt particles loose, like in Star Trek's sonic showers, and not require actual paper or physical contact. Or unless a wirelessly controlled bidet becomes ubiquitous.
</td></tr></table>

<p>I know of someone who DID build a taser into a phone... (but that's all it is now, was no space for the phone's electronics anymore) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.54.39" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.54.39">172.69.54.39</a> 08:05, 7 October 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Well, there are actual commercial taser phone cases available for purchase today - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/XaJSYxit1qI">here's one example</a>. Not necessarily a good idea and not legal everywhere, but it exists. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NeatNit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NeatNit (page does not exist)">NeatNit</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NeatNit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NeatNit (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:03, 7 October 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>And even without checking if it already existed, tasers immediately struck me as the only idea in the comic that was remotely plausible.  Most of the things in the list for one would require additional hardware to be a part of the phone, and the added weight and bulk would not seem worthwhile given the expected times one would use these things.  One exception would be a steering wheel, as using wireless comunication, any necessary hardware could be added to the car instead of the phone.  This doesn't seem like a good idea though normally, but once you have driverless cars, commands for where the car should go might be incorporated into a phone app.  And theoretically, maybe you could have a dog wear an electric shock collar that would trigger if it got too far away from the phone without changing much on the phone hardware, though it seems there would be a lot of possible issues with making that work.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.59.126" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.59.126">172.68.59.126</a> 04:49, 9 October 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd> A nail clipper might be a bit much, but I actually do use my iPhone 5 as a nail file. Once I finally upgrade it (long overdue), I will no longer be able to use my phone for that—the iPhone 5 was the last model to have a hard 90° glass edge all around the home button, an edge that happens to work perfectly for smoothing off any snags or rough edges that remain after I've trimmed my nails with scissors. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tracy_Hall&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tracy Hall (page does not exist)">Tracy Hall</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tracy_Hall&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tracy Hall (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:32, 15 October 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd> That's because no one sane would do that&#160;;) Some may use a Smart Watch instead of a classic watch but except of the case when you were used to pocket watches anyways a replacement of a wacth by a phone would be a downgrade usability wise. /edit: That being said: My personal "Now" bar is at the first quarter (more or less at the web browser's bar end) <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User:Elektrizikekswerk">Elektrizikekswerk</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User talk:Elektrizikekswerk">talk</a>) 08:29, 7 October 2019 (UTC)So that physics is nothing but the harmonies of the vibrating rubber bands. </dd></dl>

<dl><dd> The time taken isn't awfully relevant, unless you're checking the time awfully frequently. For the number of times a day I need to check the time when I'm not at a computer or already looking at my phone, the convenience of a wristwatch could easily be outweighed by the inconvenience of taking it off and putting in on each day. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.178.69" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.178.69">162.158.178.69</a> 09:34, 7 October 2019 (UTC)

I'm wearing a wrist watch since I was 8 or 9.

</p><p>Hmmm - so let's fact check this:
</p>
<ul><li> My phone is indeed being used as a car key (I own a Tesla and my phone unlocks the car and lets me drive it), phone, camera, newspaper, credit card and flashlight - so short bars for all of these is good.</li>
<li> As a TV remote, that could be true - but we're actually edging into a "post-phone" era on that one.  I can (and occasionally do) use my phone to control the Roku - but it's easier to use voice commands through Google Home for that...although I suppose I could use the phone to run Google Home instead of the Google Mini in my living room...so 50/50 on being "post-phone" on this one.</li>
<li> As a Web Browser, I could use the phone - but only rarely actually do that.  Mostly I use my ChromeBook for that, and also the screen on my Tesla - the piddly little cellphone screen guarantees it won't take over that role for more than 10% of the time.</li>
<li> He missed out "Text messaging" - but I'm using the phone less and less for that because having a decent keyboard is good - so the ChromeBook is stealing that capability.</li>
<li> Steering wheel...well, the Tesla already steers itself about 80% of the time that I drive. I predict that the steering wheel will cease to exist (at least for me) before I use my phone for that...although it certainly is capable of it in theory...and I'm pretty sure Tesla demonstrated the car being used as a radio controlled toy from a phone a few years ago...although it never made it into production (mercifully!).</li>
<li> You probably could use a phone as a bird feeder (for smaller birds - draping a dead rabbit over it to attract vultures might be a bad idea).</li>
<li> All of the others are well into the future...so I agree with him on those.</li></ul>

</p><p>I feel like we could/should be reading this more literally.  If we assume that Randall lives on the fairly early edge of technology, then the time from the left side of the chart to now is ~25 years.  If we also assume that the time axis is linear, then we should be driving our cars with our phones in 7-8 years (though I can now drive my car through a parking lot at least using my phone, it's still doing the steering for me).  Sadly brushing our teeth is still about 20 years out according to this prediction, however maybe by then our phones will be able to do some sort of ultrasonic cleaning. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jasonk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jasonk (page does not exist)">Jasonk</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jasonk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jasonk (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:58, 7 October 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Any of the many <i>many</i> smartphones with an infrared port can control any number of common devices. Every Samsung Galaxy phone is effectively a universal remote, all the user needs to do is download one of hundreds of free apps &amp; <i>bam</i>, their device is now a fully programmable touchscreen universal remote with customizable buttons, labels, &amp; scripted sequences. A "Smart" TV is not needed, but most of those actually use infrared remotes as well (<i>some</i> use RF remotes, but even TVs with WiFi typically still use an infrared remote until you get up into the more expensive models). Infrared is still used all over the place; in fact, with the proliferation of household devices with remotes, I'd wager that the average home has <i>more</i> infrared controlled devices in it today than ten or twenty years ago, when I first started using my Palm PDAs &amp; then Palm Treo as a universal remote. Randall is pretty technologically savvy &amp; also seems to be an early adopter, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's been using his smartphone as a remote since before the first iPhone was released.

<p>If you think about it, the phone started out with maybe 4 components: microphone, speaker, bell ringer, and gizmo to alert the operator to connect to you.  Newspaper was paper and ink.  Flashlight was bulb and battery.  They had nothing in common at all.   So dog leash?  Better GPS + bluetooth shock collar.  Tazer?  Better battery + extendable prongs.  Toilet paper is easy: bluetooth enabled bidet.  Honestly, the only device I would bet money on being wrong is the bird feeder.

They are mostly, but not exclusively, monotonically increasing in time.  <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mwh001&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mwh001 (page does not exist)">Mwh001</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mwh001&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mwh001 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd>I didn't research this, but it looks like the order of availibility it is sorted by. But web browser wasn't used at first, because it was just so expensive and hard to use. TV remote apps are available for quite some time, but often it is easier to just grab the remote when its close to the sofa, instead of opening the app. It remains unclear, why he switched at all. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 08:22, 8 October 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Make America Grate Again</dt></dl>
<p>Randall may be onto something with the cheese grater.  If Americans ever stop grating their cheese and someone wants to force them to resume, then they could start a movement to require cell phones be designed so that you have to grate cheese with the phone before you can use the phone for anything else, and this movement could use the slogan "Make America Grate Again", and the existing MAGA hats.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.34.92" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.34.92">172.69.34.92</a> 04:52, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>A dog leash is entirely plausible, you put a real shock-collar on the dog, then control it from the phone. But I'm disappointed that it's not a graph of how much time per day one spends doing each task on the phone. Because using it like a phone would be the shortest one, just as in the pic above. — <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kazvorpal" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kazvorpal</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kazvorpal" title="User talk:Kazvorpal">talk</a>) 16:23, 8 October 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Ever see the “pomegranate”?</dt></dl>
<p>A few years ago I saw a video (spoof) of a new tech device.  It was a phone with increasingly implausible and absurd features.  Started off with a language translator well ahead of state of the art.  Went on to things including coffee maker and harmonica.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate_(phone)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate_(phone)</a>

<dl><dt>What about using your phone to check if the milk in your fridge has gone sour?</dt></dl>
<p>It seems that they keep adding new sensors to phones, and an "Electronic Nose" is a bizarre sensor that does actually exist.  Eventually, it will become a required sensor on some future Android or Apple device.  I'd like to see a cartoon where someone is searching for their phone, so they don't have to use their actual nose and risk smelling sour milk!
</p><p>Why would it be necessary to replace all the functions of brushing one's teeth? There is nowhere in the comic he indicates this.
I would also like to point out that currently, phone-operated toilet paper would be incredibly useful. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.63.219" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.63.219">172.69.63.219</a> 01:32, 5 December 2020 (UTC)
