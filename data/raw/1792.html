<p>This comic is a logical comparison of observations to resolve the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034247/quotes?item=qt0317455">classic Superman catchphrase</a> of comic book bystanders: "Look, up in the sky... It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Airplane">bird</a>!... It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bird">plane</a>!... It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Superman">Superman</a>!", hence the title. Superman, a character originally created for comic books in the 1930s, is an alien with superpowers, including the power of unaided flight; hence the catchphrase exclaiming peoples' amazement. 
</p><p>At the correct distance both birds, planes and the fictional Superman could be mistaken for each other. So this comic aims to help people identify the airborne object by listing on which properties they are alike and on which they are different. This problem was also mentioned in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1633:_Possible_Undiscovered_Planets" title="1633: Possible Undiscovered Planets">1633: Possible Undiscovered Planets</a>, putting Superman near the bird/plane boundary explaining why all this confusion has arisen.
</p><p>The observations compared range from the mundane to the bizarre and they are listed and explained below in the <a href="#Table">table</a>. Here some highlights are mentioned, but for all these there are much more detail below.
</p><p>Some of the mundane observations are that birds don't fly around with people, while Superman can do it, and planes are meant for it;  and that the latter two are new "inventions", whereas birds have flown around for millions of years. 
</p><p>Interestingly enough there are actually two observations that have check mark for all three; the first being that there are enthusiasts for all three different flying objects. And these will obsess over small color details in otherwise similar looking objects. The other common thing is that they all may have sex in midair. The possibility of that happening for the all three are discussed in the table. 
</p><p>Three observations only counts for birds, where all those that do not count for birds do count for both planes and superman. Two of these relates to the fact that birds are eaten by cats and humans, the last is that birds flap their wings to fly, the others have other means of flight. There are observations that rules out only planes or only superman, but none that rules out only one of them at the same time as birds are ruled out.
</p><p>There are also three direct jokes towards the bottom. The first is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:David Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> may also have observed Superman's mating habits just like he has with birds in the documentary series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Birds" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Life of Birds">The Life of Birds</a>. The second is that not only birds poop in flight, but that Superman could and would also do so. And the third (and also final observation) is that not only birds chase insects to eat them, but Superman also chases them... though only when he is bored. These last three observations have that in common that the planes are left out of all of them, and the joke is always on Superman. As it has been before in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1384:_Krypton" title="1384: Krypton">1384: Krypton</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1394:_Superm*n" title="1394: Superm*n">1394: Superm*n</a> (released just ten comics apart).
</p><p>The title text refers to black stickers (decals) in the shape of an easily recognizable predatory bird, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcons" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Falcons">falcons</a> to enhance the visibility of clear glass windows or doors and scare smaller birds away before they crash into the window. This may actually not work very well according to this article: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/why-birds-hit-windows-and-how-you-can-help-prevent-it/">Why Birds Hit Windows</a>, where a falcon decal is also shown. But they are meant to warn birds away and according to this comic they could also prevent Superman from flying through your window (and thus also stop him from possibly just continuing through the building). They are not known to affect the risk of airplanes flying into the building.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>

<td colspan="4"> Some birds are capable of flying off while carrying a small human away, but this happens extremely rarely (although hoax stories are often reported).  An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ostrich">Ostrich</a> can easily carry a human; and this happens regularly in arranged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ostrich#Racing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Common ostrich">races</a>. The context of the strip implies that it's referring to birds in flight, so flightless birds like ostriches are ignored.
<p>Most planes are specifically designed to carry human passengers, although many are cargo planes with humans only acting as crew, and autonomous drones without humans also exist.
</p><p>Superman often carries other people with him, such as his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Lane" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lois Lane">girlfriend</a>, rescued victims or the various villains that people need to be rescued from.

<p>Planes sometimes fly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_flying" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Formation flying">group formation</a>, particularly when engaged in military operations where mutual support is tactically useful (or when conducting practice maneuvers for such operations). Though the people who would mistake those planes for birds will mainly see this at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_show" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Air show">air shows</a>.
</p><p>Superman is a unique person, and thus does not fly in groups at all. While Superman occasionally operates alongside other flying superheroes, and in some stories is duplicated or split into multiple beings, Randall apparently considers these circumstances too unusual to meet the "often" qualifier.

<td colspan="4"> Birds often poop during flight, often enough that people regularly get hit in the head by the poop, which has caused the unlucky people to come up with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://thepetwiki.com/wiki/Pets_and_Superstitions">superstition</a> that it brings good luck. For birds it is just economical to shed excess mass when they are going to fly, and many birds poop just at take off. But on long flights it the best use of resources to not carry extra weight along, that increases their efficiency. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mammals">mammals</a> who pee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Urea">urea</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird#Excretory_system" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bird">bird poop</a> is both pee and feces as birds only have one hole, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cloaca">cloaca</a>, and the black poop is surrounded by their pee which is the white stuff containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Uric acid">uric acid</a>. Not peeing lots of water out reduces their water loss.
<p>There have long existed urban myths about airplanes regularly discharging their septic tanks, resulting in blocks of blue ice crushing houses and people. This line refers to that myth, and the fact that it's untrue. A leaky septic disposal system can unintentionally discharge liquid waste while in flight, but this is not how the craft are designed.
</p><p>As Superman's physiology is nearly identical to that of a human, he is in theory capable of voluntarily voiding his bowels at any time, including during flight. There would be little reason for him to do so, but he presumably has the ability to do so.

<p>Randall missed that a plane can lose it's ability to fly via excessive icing on surfaces.  While it is not usually the way in which it is cured (using deicing solution and onboard aircraft systems to melt them,) sunbathing the plane in greater than freezing temperatures is an excellent way to regain the ability to fly.

</p><p>There were several aircraft in the early days of flight that had toilets that were directly connected outside. One such one, the Supermarine Stranraer, got the nickname "whistling shithouse" because when the toilet seat was lifted, the airflow through the tube caused it to whistle. Also, during WW2 on bomber aircraft, they would sometimes crap in a cardboard box and throw it overboard rather than use the difficult to use and unpopular chemical toilets. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.17" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.17">108.162.250.17</a> 06:59, 7 February 2017 (UTC)
