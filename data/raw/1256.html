<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google">Google</a>, a rather popular internet search engine, has a feature known as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en">autocomplete</a> that guesses at search queries before they are fully typed out. These guesses are generally made based on popular searches by other people. From time to time, a particularly strange or hilarious one may be found, as is evidenced in this comic.
</p><p>The largest pictured questions are: "Why are there slaves in the bible" and "Why are there ants in my laptop".
</p><p>All of the questions in the comic are "why" questions, so many of them are predicated on false assumptions, such as "Why are there pyramids on the moon". All these questions and many more (33,171 in total) can be found in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/why.txt">http://xkcd.com/why.txt</a>.
</p><p>Regarding the title text: in the Peter Jackson films of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings (film series)"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy</a>, Arwen becomes sickly for unspecified reasons as the plot advances, apparently giving Aragorn a more personal reason to fight. The only explanation given is by Elrond, who says "As Sauron's power grows, her [Arwen's] strength wanes." This subplot is entirely absent from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings">original novels</a>.
</p>
From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/faq#.2.1.21">IMDB</a>: <br /><blockquote>
Arwen, like her father (and brothers) is considered to be a Half-Elf, the result of a union between an Elf and a mortal human. The Half-Elven of Middle-earth get a choice, to remain immortal and return to the West (Valinor) or to become mortal and to die as humans do. Elrond chose to remain an Elf. Arwen (like her uncle Elros) chooses to become mortal in order to wed and remain with Aragorn. Elrond senses this; this is what he means when he says that Arwen is dying. It is the same as in The Last Unicorn, when the unicorn is given the form of a human woman and can feel that she is no longer immortal ("I can feel this body dying all around me"). According to Tolkien, though, after Aragorn dies in the year 120 (Fourth Age), Arwen returns to L√≥rien, where she dies by choice the following winter. </blockquote>

</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Why aren't my arms growing?</td>
<td>Arms stop growing because longer arms would not be a very useful way to spend resources. Human DNA has programmed the body to gradually ossify (turn to bone) the growing arms and legs, closing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Epiphyseal plate">epiphyseal plate</a> (the flat plate at the end of each long bone), at which point they stop growing. Alternately, the muscles of the arm, which may have been the intended subject of the question, may fail to grow if not exercised with appropriate resistance, repetition or frequency; if nutrition is insufficient; if insufficient recovery time is given; or if sufficient levels of certain hormones like growth hormone or testosterone are not present.

<tr>
<td>Why are there ghosts?</td>
<td>There is no hard evidence of ghosts. The reason you are seeing ghosts could be pareidolia or some cognitive bias.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Why are there squirrels?</td>
<td>Squirrels are the product of a long sequence of evolution, like any other animal. They persist because they effectively reproduce and compete for resources within their niche, but they are also the product of many circumstantial events that has led to them being the way they are.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Why is sex so important?</td>
<td>Sex is important biologically because it is the primary method of reproduction in many different species, and culturally because it both plays an important role in human relationship and causes hard-to-control urges that affect behaviour. However, it can be of varying importance to different people (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.asexuality.org/home/?q=overview.html">asexuality</a>).

<td> Why aren't there guns in Harry Potter? </td>
<td> In the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> universe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Guns">guns</a> <i>do</i> exist and are mentioned at the beginning of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, when the news gives a warning that Sirius Black has one. Muggle technology (human inventions) are often looked down on by wizards - the majority of half-blooded wizards won't touch one, let alone a wizard extremist like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voldemort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Voldemort">Voldemort</a>. Not only does any Muggle device more complex than a wristwatch interfere with magical artifacts, but wands are usually more versatile than most guns; a revolver can't shoot lightning, summon items or teleport its user. Finally, while Harry himself may or may not consider using firearms due to his Muggle upbringing, <i>Harry Potter</i> is set in the United Kingdom (which has stricter gun laws than, say, the United States).

<td> Why is sea salt better? </td>
<td> The question likely refers to the difference between common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortified_table_salt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fortified table salt">Fortified table salt</a> and usually more expensive sea salt. While the major part of both of these is sodium chloride (NaCl) the idea behind the claim is the different composition mostly in regards to trace elements of sea salt compared to "normal" salt. Table salt's composition is often influenced by a country's health department and thus addition of trace elements is regulated. While these regulations are based on scientific studies there remain to be debates concerning the additions, such as iodine.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Why are there trees in the middle of fields? </td>
<td> Many images of fields contain singular trees in the middle of them. While there exist such trees it is likely an artistic choice to give a more pleasing or aesthetically satisfying image compared to just a field. In modern agriculture those would in fact be quite troublesome since they are a hindrance to large machines used and a new tree would be unlikely to grow in a constantly worked field, although they can be useful in fields for grazing animals, since they provide shade. Before mechanized agriculture, such trees would also be planted to give the workers a place rest in the shade without having to go all the way back from a large field.

<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pok√©mon">Pok√©mon</a> is a popular franchise, spanning game consoles, anime series, a trading card game, and many other things. Among fans, it is a frequent topic of discussion why a Pok√©mon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online game">massively multiplayer online game</a> has not been officially announced by the series' developers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Game Freak">Game Freak</a>, as they often <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dorkly.com/comic/52546/be-careful-what-you-wish-for">predict</a> that such a game would be extremely popular, and bring in massive revenue for the company. However, if Game Freak were to develop a Pok√©mon MMO the MMOs would be strong competition against the console games and therefore reducing the Pok√©mon demographic significantly. The mobile app <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pok√©mon Go">Pok√©mon Go</a> has since partly filled the MMO niche, with multiplayer interactivity through item drops and fighting at gyms.

<td>Why is there laughing in TV shows? </td>
<td> Sitcoms were once filmed with an audience, so the actors could respond to their reactions. That's the historical reason why there were laughs in TV shows. The tradition continues, with the difference that now the laughter mostly comes from recorded tapes. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Laugh track">Laugh track</a>.

<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Antarctica">Antarctica</a> is the southern most continent and is by large covered in ice and in general pretty cold. While it is a regular target of tourists and researchers it also lacks native human inhabitants. At the moment, the territorial claims concerning Antarctica are mostly handled via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty System</a>. In short there are a few countries who claim certain parts of the continent as their own in theory but so far it is considered neutral territory and most maps don't concern themselves with displaying the (in some regards disputed) territorial claims because they do not matter at this point in time. If there are ever any worthwhile resources discovered, this might change.

<td>Why do snakes exist?</td>
<td> The question is rather general and likely based on a widespread dislike for the reptilians. Be it due to their appearance, their spread, or the danger a few snakes pose to humans (often due to being venomous) many people have a dislike for snakes and would prefer them to not exist (similar to spiders).
<p>In regards to "why do snakes exist on earth?": Because evolution. Snakes fill a gap in the ecosystem as predators and hunt different species, including vermin. Snakes are in that regard similar to many other predatory animals. The question on why snakes developed with their distinct streamlined shape is still debated but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Snakes">likely it either provided an advantage when burrowing or swimming</a>.

<td>Why do oysters have pearls?</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pearl">From Wikipedia</a>: <blockquote>Pearls are formed inside the shell of certain mollusks as a defense mechanism against a potentially threatening irritant such as a parasite inside the shell, or an attack from outside, injuring the mantle tissue. The mollusk creates a pearl sac to seal off the irritation. Pearls are commonly viewed by scientists as a by-product of an adaptive immune system-like function.</blockquote>

Both are children living in the small titular town in Colorado. Cartman is widely accepted to a be very bad person, one of his many character flaws being his antisemitism. Kyle on the other hand is a Jew. However, both, along with two other kids, Stan and Kenny, are the core focus of the show (or used to be) and to some extent are considered to be friends. While there are episodes which show Cartman being not entirely a horrible person and him holding Kyle in a position of at least a worthy adversary, most of the time the question should be "Why is anyone friends with Cartman?" However, they most likely remain "friends" because they are in the same class at school and are therefore "forced" to be around one another.

To give the aliens a more sophisticated and threatening demeanor, the Klingons were depicted with ridged foreheads, snaggled and prominent teeth, and a defined language and alphabet. Lee Cole, a production designer, used red gels and primitive shapes in the design of Klingon consoles and ship interiors, which took on a dark and moody atmosphere. The alphabet was designed as angular, with sharp edges harkening to the Klingon's militaristic focus.[5] Costume designer Robert Fletcher created new uniforms for the Klingons, reminiscent of feudal Japanese armor.</blockquote>

<td>Why is programming so hard?</td>
<td>Programming is the art of writing instructions for a computer to do. Since the computer has a limited set of instructions for you to use it involves a new way of thinking for many. It is also hard because the computer itself is not smart or adaptable to unexpected problems. For instance when humans are told to sort books in a shelf, they can do that even if there are things in the way (simply moving them to the side). A computer will generally just crash if it doesn't have instructions on how to deal with the unexpected problem.

<td> Why aren't economists rich? </td>
<td> Economists study how society organises resources but, contrary to the popular misconception, don't focus much on the short-term behaviour of the stock market (a system that is still poorly understood). In order to become rich, in most cases one has to own a commodity that produces more wealth, such as a large company, or be related to somebody who has done so. In rare cases, a particularly lucky individual could become rich by having an unusually high paying job, such as a famous actor or sports star. Neither of these situations are likely for someone studying the field of economics. Some economists do get very rich as strategists for banks and businesses, but most are just academics and analysts.

However, in general his anti-authority personality makes him a difficult team-member to field, and he has frequently disassociated himself even from the X-Men. But, in Avengers vs. X-Men (see above) Wolverine <i>sided</i> with The Avengers, and more modern treatments have even included the character in about as much a permanent a membership of the group as Logan is ever likely to have.

Unless there is studio agreement, the two properties cannot cross, except through complicated machinations. For example, there are plans to bring Avengers mainstays Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch to both the <i>Avengers</i> and <i>X-Men</i> franchises, but only the Fox films have the right to call them the children of Magneto, and Marvel/Disney cannot even identify them on-screen as "mutants".

<td> Why is dying so scary? </td>
<td>Part of human nature is the fear of the unknown, and death is the ultimate unknown because it is not knowable until it's experienced, and there is nobody to report what the result was. This leaves it open to speculation, and many major religions are based on preparing ones soul for death. Also, dying would leave loved ones families with the responsibility of taking care of their remains and finances. And finally, most people don't want to die, living for as long as possible, possibly because the unknown is too unbearable to cope with. Several causes of death are known to inflict pain to the victim, and fear of pain is an instilled evolutionary safeguard for preventing harm to a sapient creature. Still though several people are not afraid of death and dying, and recognize life is short and to cherish each moment while we can. Death is inevitable, so we should not fear it. In addition, it would be evolutionarily advantageous for our ancestors to have feared and avoided death.

<td> Why is isolation bad? </td>
<td>Isolation is when a person deliberately secludes themselves away from others, often far-removed from society. This can happen in locations as small as a city apartment and as large as the open woods. People evolved as social animals and it is generally held that those who isolate themselves suffer from depression or other forms of psychological imbalance. Of course society can trigger many of these imbalances causing an individual to isolate themselves. Isolation is often seen as therapeutic so people can spend time with themselves constructively, often finding peace within themselves and through mediation. Monks and hermits generally live in solitude as well. Many people view a decision to be isolated as noble, and others as healthy. While general interaction is largely healthy, in the crowded modern world, isolation is neither good or bad; it depends on the person and what that isolation does to them.

<td> Why is lying good? </td>
<td>Lying and other forms of dishonesty is typically seen as bad because it lowers one's credibility and makes them less likely to be trusted in the future. It is almost always advantageous to tell the truth, as lies have a way of escalating as you need to keep expanding on the lie to cover your tracks. There are instances however where lying may be used in more noble circumstances. For example, if a friend asks your opinion on something they have made (such as a poem or painting) that you do not like, it is okay to tell them you like it because protecting their feelings and your relationship is more important than how you feel. Often military personnel are trained to keep national security secrets at all costs and will lie about what they know to save themselves and the country.

Similarly slave owners rationalized their ownership through scripture, pointing out that it was in the Bible and therefore okay with God ‚Äî without wishing to go off on a tangent, if you have to rationalize your system of slavery then it's probably illegal under historic Jewish law.

LeGeuin in which she makes a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotic</a> analysis of dragon mythology. She argues that our belief in dragons (and those outside of America as well) stems from childhood, much like other ferocious fictional creatures such as goblins and hobbits, but many hold onto these fears as a way of avoiding reality. In her closing argument, she writes, "They know that its truth challenges, even threatens, all that is false, all that is phony, unnecessary, and trivial in the life they have let themselves be forced into living. They are afraid of dragons, because they are afraid of freedom."

Presumably, this question is asked by Americans who assume that the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_facilities_of_the_United_States_by_country" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Category:Military facilities of the United States by country">U.S. military bases abroad</a> is a general trend among countries, as opposed to being the rarity that it is. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_overseas_military_bases" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of countries with overseas military bases">only a handful of other countries</a> have military bases outside of their borders, and the three‚Äî<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:France">France</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Russia">Russia</a>‚Äîthat have more than one or two are all countries that, like the United States, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Allies of World War II">were on the winning side of World War II</a>, have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of countries by military expenditures">massive military expenditures</a>, and have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United Nations Security Council veto power">UN Security Council vetoes</a>. In other words, only the most militarily elite countries have bases overseas. The U.S. is unique, however, in that it has far more overseas bases than any other country (and, pretty much, far more of anything else than any other country, when it comes to the military), and in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_bases" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of United States military bases">it has bases in several other highly-industrialized nations</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_installations_in_South_Korea" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of United States Army installations in South Korea">South Korea</a> and the United Kingdom, and, most notably, the World War II <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Axis powers">Axis powers</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_installations_in_Germany" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of United States Army installations in Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_s_Japan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States s Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_installations_in_Italy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of United States Army installations in Italy">Italy</a>. France, Russia, and the U.K.'s bases, on the other hand, are almost all within areas that they previously controlled.</p><p>These bases can be controversial in some countries, while in others they are a major source of economic and political stability. The U.S. traditionally justifies their presence as a necessary and crucial element in its efforts to promote peace domestically and worldwide. Despite their major role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._foreign_policy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:U.S. foreign policy">U.S. foreign policy</a>, and in the general political structure of the globe, the American public often largely ignores them, and they rarely become a major political issue (apart from an occasional mention by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Libertarian Party (United States)">Libertarian presidential s</a>).</p><p>So, essentially, the absence of foreign military bases within the U.S. is primarily because there aren't really any other countries in a position to place bases there. Ironically, although no battles in the traditional sense have been fought within the U.S. since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Civil_War" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:U.S. Civil War">U.S. Civil War</a> and the U.S. mainland has seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_invasion_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mainland invasion of the United States">almost no military action</a>, foreign air  bases might have been useful on September 11, 2001. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> in 1941 was 18  before Hawaii became a U.S. state, but Hawaii was still a fundamental part of the United States as it was an incorporated territory.)</p><p>There are, however, foreign troops stationed at some continental US military bases. For example, RAF (British Royal Air ) 39 Sqn and 361 Sqn at Creech Air  Base in Nevada flying Reaper and Predator s. But this are not foreign military bases, they are just guests.</p>

The various name changes, mergers, and splits of kingdoms are complicated.</i><p>The basis for this question is that for the past several hundred years, there has almost always been a queen in England, the sole exceptions being when the king has not had a wife. However, there is a distinction between being the queen of England (that is to say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_monarchs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of British monarchs">a monarch</a>) and being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_consort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Queen consort">queen <i>consort</i></a> of England: The former refers to a woman who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_British_throne" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Succession to the British throne">succeeded to the throne</a> in her own right, becoming sovereign, while the latter refers to the wife of the king. Both roles, though, are commonly referred to as "Queen of England," creating the impression that there is always such a person. The logical question, therefore, is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elizabeth II">Elizabeth II</a>'s now-deceased husband, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prince Philip">Philip</a>, is not considered the king of England. The answer lies in England's system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Male-preference cognatic primogeniture">male-preference cognatic primogeniture</a>, which causes the monarch of England to usually be a man, not a woman. As a result of this, British laws were generally built around the presumption that the monarch would be a man, and that said man would be married to a woman, <a href="/wiki/index.php/223:_Valentine%27s_Day" title="223: Valentine&#39;s Day">comic 223</a> be damned. Since the creation of the modern British throne in 1707, only two women have reigned as queen in their own right; it just so happens that these two women have been two of the most famous and longest-reigning monarchs in world history, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and Queen Elizabeth II. This fact may add to people's enhanced perception of the lack of a British king. Victoria and Elizabeth's respective consorts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_Prince_Consort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Albert, Prince Consort">Albert</a> and Philip, have been styled as princes&#8212;Albert as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Consort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prince Consort">Prince Consort</a> and Philip as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_prince" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:British prince">Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>." Both were explicitly granted their titles by their wives, though Albert was already a prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Philip had previously been a prince of Denmark and Greece, but had renounced both titles before marrying Elizabeth.</p><p>The title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_consort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:King consort">king consort</a> also exists, but has never been used in England.</p><p>Notably, should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prince Charles">Prince Charles</a> succeed to his mother's throne, it has been announced that his wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall">Camilla</a>, will be styled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_consort" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Princess consort">princess consort</a>, <i>not</i> as queen consort, just as she has declined the title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_of_Wales" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Princess of Wales">Princess of Wales</a>, which is strongly associated with Charles's first wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Diana" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Princess Diana">Diana</a>. Assuming that Charles succeeds, this means that England will not have anyone referred to as "queen," after decades of not having anyone referred to as "king."</p>

<td> Why are there weeks? </td>
<td> Weeks were originally important for religious reasons, primarily the requirement to observe a sabbath (day of rest) every seventh day. Today it is used to create a common schedule that doesn't change due to month length, much like the months divide a year to be able to schedule things like dentist appointments. Similarly, hours and minutes divide a day making it possible to create a schedule.

For example, in Seattle, when I type "washington", I get suggestions related to Washington state and not the District of Columbia.

</p><p>The term "King Consort" may not have been used in the UK, but i believe it was used before in pre Act of Unification England. When Mary Tudor married Philip II of Spain, he was accepted by Parliament and the court as King of England, but was not granted any power. It may not have been elevated to an official title yet, but he was king consort. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Dr_Pepper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Dr Pepper (page does not exist)">Dr Pepper</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Dr_Pepper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Dr Pepper (page does not exist)">talk</a>) Dr Pepper
</p><p>My question is "Why do we need to answer all the questions, when the answers have nothing to do with the comic?". The answers are fun and interesting, but they should be in the trivia section. The comic is explained well without them. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.217.125" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.217.125">108.162.217.125</a> 21:36, 8 August 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Maybe because this is a wiki and, as such, ALL information must be present. I'm not certain whether the answers help explain the comic but, as it is, I'm not entirely sure of Randall's objective with this one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.148" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.148">108.162.219.148</a> 04:20, 2 November 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd> The purpose of this page is to EXPLAIN the comic. If you don't know what the comic is about you probably should not be trying to EXPLAIN the comic, and you probably should not comment as well. The purpose of this comic is to demonstrate in a visually interesting way the questions that we, users of the internet, ask. But without this EXPLAINATION it is fairly obvious that finding the answers to these questions do nothing to EXPLAIN the comic, especially since the answers do not give the readers any further understanding into the comic.  Adding random information to a page does not EXPLAIN anything.  Wiki does not mean ‚ÄúALL information must be present‚Äù.  Adding unnecessary information DISTRACTS from the EXPLAINATION and confuses readers, this impairs the ability of this wiki to EXPLAIN the comic. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.209">108.162.216.209</a> 21:44, 24 November 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Under "Why is outer space so cold?" it says "space is not cold", but then for "Why is there ice in space?" it begins with "space is cold".
This is somewhat confusing.  Please clarify. Is space cold or isn't it?  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.120" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.120">162.158.255.120</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:162.158.255.120&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:162.158.255.120 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>No idea how to edit the actual article, but it might be worth mentioning that the succession laws of the UK are no longer male-preference, and are now absolute cognatic primogenture/ absolute primogeniture. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.106.107" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.106.107">141.101.106.107</a> 12:45, 7 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Something's fishy.  One question has the answer "Space is Cold." and another has the answer "Space is not cold." <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.212.92" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.212.92">108.162.212.92</a> 00:24, 11 September 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>Just a random guy passing through. For the question "Why are there psychics?" the example answer seems very confusing. Perhaps someone thought the word was "physics" instead of "psychics"? (Timestamp 20:14 21 March 2019)
</p><p>Histamines are not injected into the skin in a spider's saliva. 1. It's injecting venom, not saliva. 2. Histamines are generated by the body as part of its immune response. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.63.69" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.63.69">172.69.63.69</a> 15:19, 7 April 2019 (UTC)
