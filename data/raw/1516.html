<p>In the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon">Pokémon</a></i> franchise, human characters called Trainers capture fantastical creatures from the wild, the titular Pokémon (a shortened form of "Pocket Monsters"), and train them to battle one another. Pokémon are captured and stored in devices called Poké Balls, which shrink the creatures down to pocket size (hence "Pocket Monsters"). The anime's English dub has enshrined the phrase "<i>&lt;Pokémon's name&gt;</i>, I choose you!" into popular culture memory. When Trainers do battle, they often shout this phrase while throwing the ball to the ground, releasing the Pokémon at full size.
</p><p>In this comic, a Pokémon chosen at some point was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pikachu">Pikachu</a> (the "poster child" for Pokémon, and the most publicly-known type), which does not intend to engage in the battle himself. Instead, the Pikachu chooses another Pikachu to fight for him. This process then repeats itself. Behind the Pikachu with the Pokéball is a long line of other Pikachu, suggesting that this process has been going on for a while.
</p><p>Nearby stands <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a>, holding a closed Pokéball, and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a>, looking at her watch. This suggests that Cueball intends to have his own Pokémon fight the Pikachu, but is waiting to see which enemy his Pokémon must face before the battle can actually begin (waiting in vain, if the above described process repeats indefinitely), while Megan is growing impatient with the delay. Given that Cueball is holding a closed Pokéball he has not deployed yet, Megan cannot herself be his Pokémon. She could be his opponent, or a spectator.
</p><p>The joke in this comic comes from analogy with the mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_induction" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Proof by induction">proof by induction</a>, which is a proof about a base case, followed by a never ending sequence of steps, each step leading to the next. Induction proves an assertion is true for one case, and then infers that it must also be true for all related cases. The title suggests that the process of Pikachu choosing Pikachu will never end, effectively postponing the battle indefinitely. But the title is <b>win</b> by induction, by which Randall implies that we have been given enough information to reason logically whether Megan or Cueball will win. We have here turned mathematical induction on its head: part of the humour in the comic is that the logic of induction doesn't work in reverse. We cannot reason about an initial case by inferring something from a related case whose proof is dependent on knowledge about the initial case. Or perhaps the "win" referred to is precisely that the battle is indefinitely postponed.
</p><p>The name "induction" comes from logic and discrete mathematics, and is thus unrelated to the physical phenomena of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Electromagnetic induction">electromagnetic induction</a>; but the fact that Pikachu is an "Electric-type" Pokémon could be word play connecting the two ideas.
</p><p>If there were always only a single Pikachu in each Pokéball, this would spawn an unlimited number of Pikachu growing at a constant rate. Since, as the title text notes, there are occasionally two of them in a Pokéball, this would lead to exponential growth assuming each of the spawned Pikachu in this case is bearing a Pokéball! This may be a reference to the rate of twins, which is approximately 1/30 in humans.
</p><p>Pikachu was used in one of the storylines of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1350:_Lorenz" title="1350: Lorenz">1350: Lorenz</a>. See all the attack moves it made <a href="/wiki/index.php/1350:_Lorenz#Pok.C3.A9mon" title="1350: Lorenz">here</a>.

<ul><li>For some reason Pikachu is drawn without its lightning shaped tail. Pikachu is also drawn rather stocky; this was common in early Pokémon media, but in recent times Pikachu's official design is much slimmer.</li>
<li>In Pokémon canon, Pokémon are only allowed to hold on to an <i>empty</i> Pokéball when stored in a Pokéball.</li>
<li>In Pokémon canon, only one Pokémon can exist in a Pokéball, contrary to the title text.</li>
<li>Randall has drawn the Pokéballs with the button that opens them in the middle of the red half. Whereas in actual (modern) Pokéballs the button is located where the two different halves meet. However, in the Pokémon canon, earlier Pokéballs are shown with buttons or timers on top, though it is doubtful this is the intention, unless the infinite line of Pikachus has been continuing for over thirty years.</li>
<li>The open Pokéballs are shown broken in two. While early Pokémon games occasionally stated Pokéballs could break, they are now always shown to be connected by a hinge. It is an uncommon visualization that the two halves are fully separate.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Makes sense to me. I didn't even think of double yolks until you mentioned it here. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.50.89" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.50.89">173.245.50.89</a> 09:04, 24 April 2015 (UTC)BK201

<p>The explanation currently says that doubling makes it uncountably infinite. I'm pretty sure that doubling at each step (or every few steps) is still a countable infinite set. Proof here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://practicaltypography.com/the-infinite-pixel-screen.html">http://practicaltypography.com/the-infinite-pixel-screen.html</a> (see section "The internet demands a recount", because the first attempt is wrong). We can also prove it using the same argument as when proving that N x N is countable infinite (making zig-zag), but in this case making a breadth-first search of the tree of Pikachus: map 1 to the first Pikachu, map 2 and 3 to the two Pikachus at the second level, map 4, 5, 6, 7 to the four Pikachus at the third level, map (2^(n-1))…((2^n) - 1) to the 2^(n-1) Pikachus at level n.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.229.177" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.229.177">108.162.229.177</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.229.177&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.229.177 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dd>The problem being that we don't have an exact number for how many steps include double Pikachus.

<p>"infinite, but countable" {Cough.} Someone doesn't understand infinity. Perhaps they meant "enumerable". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.155" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.155">108.162.250.155</a> 09:29, 24 April 2015 (UTC)ū

<dl><dd>enumeration is counting, in the simplest sense. "To name one by one; specify, as if in a list".

<p>"The front most Pikachu speaks." Hey, look, it has those little lines to show it's speaking, not the blank white space behind it. Duh. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.155" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.155">108.162.250.155</a> 09:32, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Are Megan and Cueball supposed to fight each other? It seems like Cueball still has his closed Pokéball in his hands. Is it then Megan's Pokéball that has evolved into all these Pikachu? And is it because she waits for her Pokémon to be ready to fight Cueball, that she checks her watch? I do not know anything about the Pokémon game/world. But it seems to me that some part of this setup is unexplained by the above... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 11:23, 24 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I've not seen many anime episodes, but in the games' battles the trainers always face each other from opposing sides. Plus, there are classes of trainers that are two people, so it could be that Megan is simply with Cueball. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/188.114.97.151" title="Special:Contributions/188.114.97.151">188.114.97.151</a> 18:58, 18 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>From an engineering standpoint, in my opinion, Pikachu act more like biological capacitors (stored electric charge at potentially high voltage able to deliver large discharge currents) than inductors ("storing" magnetic energy via constant current, able to deliver high voltage when interrupted, like the ignition coil for an older automotive engine).  I'm not too familiar with the Pokémon in-game/in-show universe, but I would imagine the Nurse Jenny corps could use electric Pokémon such as Pikachu (or Raichu) like defibrillators for cardiac events! --BigMal // <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.50.177" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.50.177">173.245.50.177</a> 11:42, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

<p>There's a point floating about how infinity doesn't imply completion.  For instance, the number of all even integers is infinite, yet any given integer "only has a 50% chance of being even", so the series is quite obviously incomplete.  This article seems to tend towards the idea (in diction) that an infinite number of pikachu would result in a win based on a 'logical' premise, without referring specificially to the terms of it's assumption. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Xerxesbeat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Xerxesbeat (page does not exist)">Xerxesbeat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Xerxesbeat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Xerxesbeat (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:38, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The observation proceeds from the fact that the cardinality of all even integers is the same as the cardinality of all natural numbers (and the cardinality of all rational numbers). You can say that there are as many even integers are there are integers, conterintuitive as that seems. This, however, has nothing to do with the reasoning behind induction. Suppose that there is a finite number that doesn't correspond with a Pikachu, we can pick the least number for which this is the case (just check all the lower numbers until we find the least non-pikachu number N). But there is a pikachu corresponding to N-1, and it is holding a pokeball with a pikachu. So the pikachu in the pokeball of pikachu N-1 is pikachu N, and we have a contradiction to our supposition. Therefore there is no finite number that doesn't correspond with a Pikachu, QED.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Aube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aube (page does not exist)">Aube</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Aube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Aube (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:29, 25 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Axiom of choice</dt></dl>
<p>Could this be to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Axiom of choice">axiom of choice</a> from set theory? From my understanding, it's a fundamental axiom of set theory that says 'given a set of sets, it's possible to choose one element from each of those sets'. "Choosing" is in this case a specific operation that can be performed on an element.
</p><p>One specific detail about the axiom is that all sets under consideration must be nonempty; that is, they must contain at least one element. So I think this is analogous to the situation of a Pokemon trainer owning multiple (full) Pokeballs: his Pokeballs are a collection of non-empty sets from which he is now trying to choose a single element ("Pikachu, I choose you!").
</p><p>Under <i>normal</i> circumstances, he can do this without invoking the axiom of choice because he knows the names of all his Pokemon and so can select one from each set. In this case, he could prove his ability to make the choice simply by releasing all of his Pokemon from their balls one at a time. (The Pokemon's name is actually irrelevant, because simply releasing the Pokemon counts as a choice).
</p><p>However, the situation becomes more complex if it turns out that his Pokemon also possess Pokeballs, because now his ability to make the choice is uncertain. In this situation, there could be <i>infinitely many</i> Pikachus, and so he can't definitely select a Pikachu from all the Pokeballs under his control. In a situation like this, a mathematician would invoke the axiom of choice.
</p><p>However, it seems that Cueball is actually having a go at it using an inductive method of choice: first by choosing a Pikachu, then having each Pikachu choose a Pikachu. If the number of Pikachus carrying Pokeballs is finite, then eventually, this will demonstrate that the choice can be made and so the axiom of choice is unnecessary. However, if it's <i>infinite</i>, then this will generate a neverending stream of Pikachus. In the latter case, the game never begins, because you can't begin a Pokemon battle until all participants have chosen Pokemon. Most likely, the other players would simply abandon the game, which Cueball could claim as a victory. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Hawthorn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hawthorn (page does not exist)">Hawthorn</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Hawthorn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Hawthorn (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:52, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I think you are confused about the AoC. AoC states that given any collection of elements, you can choose an element from EACH set. If you are choosing a pokemon from a collection of pokeballs, it's equivalent to choosing one full pokeball from the collection and you are picking an element from a single set, which doesn't involve the AoC (this is something you can always do as long as the set is non-empty). In the example in the comic, AoC is not needed because there is already a natural ordering (ignoring the alt-text, which would make the set a partial ordering), so it's trivial to construct a choice function for any subset (choose the "least" pikachu in the sequence). On the other hand, if we have infinite pikachus running wild, we would need the Axiom of Choice (preferably its equivalent, the Well-Ordering Theorem) to assert that they can be ordered so that all of them except one is captured in a pokeball held by another pikachu.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Aube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aube (page does not exist)">Aube</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Aube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Aube (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:10, 25 April 2015 (UTC)
