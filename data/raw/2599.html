<p>This comic is a misunderstanding of statistics very similar to that of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1252:_Increased_Risk" title="1252: Increased Risk">1252: Increased Risk</a>. It suggests that going outside for more than 5 hours per day significantly increases your risk of head injury from falling spacecraft, and advises to limit outside activity to avoid this risk. 
</p><p>The data are apparently based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Method" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Monte Carlo Method">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, a computational method that uses input values randomly drawn from a given distribution and which repeats that calculation many times; the distribution of the outputs is then analyzed. This method is used to determine the possible outcomes (and their respective probabilities) for a given scenario. Basically, instead of doing hard math to calculate the outcomes you let a computer repeat the scenario for a huge number of different input values and watch what happens.
In this case, the study might have consisted of defining the baseline probability of spacecraft debris falling from the sky in a given time frame (say, 1% every minute) as well as the probability that it is heavy enough to break through the roof (say, also 1%), translating this to the output of a random number generator (e.g. "1" means "space debris falls in direction of head and can break through the roof", 2-100 means "space debris falls in direction of head  but can't go through a roof" and values 101-10000 mean "no danger from space debris"), adding another random number generator to simulate the distributions for "person is outside X hours of the day", then drawing numbers repeatedly from both distributions and calculating the outcome for each instance.
</p><p>Doing a Monte Carlo simulation for a hypothetical and rare scenario like this can make sense: it is so rare for humans to be struck by spacecraft debris that an absurdly large sample size, involving tens of millions of participants over several decades, would be necessary to obtain significant experimental data.
However, the statistical analysis and presentation of the data is horribly misleading and sensationalizing. The comic essentially pokes fun at the way that data can be misrepresented and exaggerated using an example that people  would realize is absurdly unlikely. 
</p><p>The results are presented not as an overall probability but rather as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Odds ratio">odds ratio</a> of the probabilities. The odds ratio is defined as p(A happens in presence of B)/p(A happens in absence of B), which here would be p(space debris head injury after Xh spent outside and 24-Xh inside)/p(space debris head injury after 24h spent inside). The resulting value tells you how much more likely an outcome becomes if you do (or have) A. E.g. the bottom line of the graph in the comic means that spending 11+ hours outside will make it 3 times as likely to get a head injury from space debris compared to not being outside at all.
However, while odds ratios can be useful they tend to hide the scale of a probability - e.g. 0.00000000002%/0.00000000001% = 2, the outcome became twice as likely but the probability only rose by 0.00000000001%. And since the odds of being hit in the head by (any part of) a falling spacecraft are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.livescience.com/33511-falling-nasa-satellite-uars-risk.html">astronomically low to begin with</a>, even quadrupling it still results in a negligible probability.
</p><p>The choice of hour brackets instead of a linear time scale is suspicious. Monte Carlo simulations involve a huge number of computations; the scientists should have more than enough data to plot the odds ratio for every additional hour spent outside. Moreover, each hour bracket has a different size - why didn't they use a regular binning like e.g. 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12? One might suspect that they wanted to conceal inconsistencies and that the underlying data points by themselves don't look nearly as convincing.
Moreover, range-based groups of any kind should never be analyzed as if they were independent categories. Spending 5 hours outside is not intrinsically different from spending 1 hour outside - the 5-hour-mark (presumably) doesn't suddenly turn humans into space-debris magnets. The likelihood of space debris falling down at any given moment stays the same and the cumulative (i.e. summed-up) probability should increase at a constant rate. Instead of comparing every hour bracket to the same baseline reference, each should each be compared to the next-lowest value. 
</p><p>The error bars (the lines extending from the points in the graph) are HUGE compared to the effect they measured. Error bars define the range in which the true value might be - here, for 2-4 hours the true value could be an increase by 2, or a small DEcrease of the probability. 
</p><p>The data are shown on a <a href="/wiki/index.php/1162:_Log_Scale" title="1162: Log Scale">1162: Log Scale</a>. Logarithmic scales are used when you have both very small and very large values and want to depict their relative differences in a single plot without making the small values look like zero or cutting off the large values. The data shown here do not have huge differences - there is no good reason for using a log scale. However, the log scale is conveniently chosen to make the error bars look like they have the same length. They do not. The error bar for the last data point is actually twice as large as that for the first data point.
</p><p><br />
The title text continues the misuse of statistics by insinuating that a 30% decrease of cardiovascular disease resulting from going outside (and exercising) is outweighed by a simultaneous 300% increase of risk of being killed by a bear. As shown in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1102:_Fastest-Growing" title="1102: Fastest-Growing">1102: Fastest-Growing</a>, the percentage increase/decrease alone of something has little meaning; the context of the original size is needed to evaluate how impressive the change really is. And in this case, the probability of dying from a cardiovascular disease is much, MUCH higher than the probability of being attacked and killed by a bear, so the moderate decrease of the former has much more impact on one's overall life expectancy than even a huge increase of the latter (unless you live in an area that has many bears, in which case your best bet is to take appropriate precautions rather than to never go outside at all).
</p><p>The "280% increase" of the title text is also an error, though perhaps not for reasons you might assume at first glance (the correct calculation is not "300% − 30% = 270%"). To "increase by 300%" means to add 300% on top of the original 100% (=400%, so multiplied by 4), while to "decrease by 30%" means to remove 30% from the original 100% (=70%, so multiplied by 0.7). Combining these (which is very very wrong!) would mean multiplying by both, for an overall change of 4.0 × 0.7 = 2.8, or 280%. However, this should be read as an increase <i>to</i> 280% of its old value, not <i>by</i> 280% (you started at 100% and added 180%). But this is a very, very wrong way of doing the math because these are probabilities of very different things with very different scales (if you threw out 30% of your dishware but in that same period also acquired 3 toothpicks on top of your original 1 toothpick, would you say that your kitchen stuff increased by 180%?). The correct way of combining the two probabilities would be to translate them onto the same scale - the overall chance of death - which would be done by multiplying each value with its probability of happening at all. For example, if the chance of dying from cardiovascular disease was 50% and the chance of being killed by a bear was 0.1%, the overall chance of dying from either would be the sum, 50.1%. Both probabilities are affected by going outside; the new chances are now 50%*0.7=35% and 0.1%*4=0.4% and the combined chance of dying from either is now 35.4% - a significant DEcrease from the original 50.1%.
</p><p><br />
The specific reference to falling spacecraft is likely inspired by events happening around the time of this comics release (March 2022).  Around a month before this was posted, the head of the Russian space agency, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Roscosmos">Roscosmos</a>, warned that sanctions against Russia (mostly those over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine">2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) could result in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:International Space Station">International Space Station</a> crashing.  Since the Russian section of the space station is the one that provides propulsion (although it is built to rely on the power generated by the other sections), this was taken seriously and as of when this was posted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:NASA">NASA</a> was trying to come up with alternative stabilization strategies in case the situation worsened. There was also a recent <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www-uol-com-br.translate.goog/tilt/noticias/redacao/2022/03/17/parte-do-foguete-spacex-e-encontrada-por-morador-do-pr.htm?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">report</a> of some 600 kg space rocket debris found in Brazil.

<dl><dd>Yeah, barring a total mistake, that must be where the number came from, but it seems odd by the inconsistent way it is expressed, as it assumes the 300% increase for the bear attack is added to the initial value for a final amount of 400%, along with a similar treatment for the 30% decrease, but the 280% is simply the final value skipping past that step to the conclusion afterwards that is not even shown for the previous numbers.  But with the improper grammar, if it's not an actual typo, it may be trying to show the speaker acting dumb or irrational, as it doesn't make sense to end with "increased" instead of "increase" without changing part of the words before that number.  Someone thinking that poorly though likely wouldn't be able to multiply things properly to produce that 280% number though.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.130.153" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.130.153">172.70.130.153</a> 01:13, 29 March 2022 (UTC)

<dd><u>Joke proof</u>: <i>Assume</i> that every year 400 people are killed by bears in the world, of which 100 are killed inside and 300 are killed outside. Then, indeed, by going outside, the probability that you will be killed by bears increases from 100 to 300: that is 300%. On the other hand, we know that walking outside every day will reduce your risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 30%. Therefore, by walking outside properly, 30% of the above-mentioned 400 people, i.e. 120 people, could in theory avoid death from the said disease, <i>if</i> not attacked by bears. This implies that, even if everyone in the world walked outside every day, only 120 out of the 400 bear attack victims would be potentially saved, while 280 would die anyway. Since by hypothesis only 100 are killed inside by bear attacks, going outside will clearly increase the probability of deadly bear attacks, from 100 to 280: that is 280%. —<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Yosei" title="User:Yosei">Yosei</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Yosei" title="User talk:Yosei">talk</a>) 09:52, 29 March 2022 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>It's a joke&#160;:) Since the title text is obviously a joke, maybe we shouldn't over-analyze it, except we can enjoy ourselves by “analyzing” it half-jokingly. Seriously, though, there is also some ambiguity in a natural language itself: e.g. by “one-and-a-half times larger than”, one may mean “one-and-a-half times as large as” (150%), or one may mean “150% larger than” (250%). When spoken informally, this kind of ambiguity is not uncommon. Another example would be “five hundred one thousandths” which may mean 501/1000 or 500/1000.

<dd>It doesn't really matter because the whole thing is complete nonsense. You can't combine the risks unless you know how big they are relative to each other. Let's say 1,000 people stay inside. 2 are killed by a bear and 10 die of cardiovascular disease - 12 people in total. With the given percentage changes, of 1,000 people who go outside, 8 get killed by bears (300% increase) and 7 die of heart disease (30% decrease), a total of 15. It's more dangerous to go outside than stay in. However, if 250 of the people who stay inside die of heart disease, then we have 252 deaths in total for staying in and only 175+8=183 for going out <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jeremyp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jeremyp (page does not exist)">Jeremyp</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeremyp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jeremyp (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:33, 29 March 2022 (UTC).</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Odds ratio confusion?</dt></dl>
<p>I am very confused by the X axis of this comic, I feel like I must be misunderstanding how this works, but I thought I understood how odds ratios worked. Maybe not.
The graph "reads" that "In the reference situation, with zero hours spent outside, the odds ratio for head injuries from falling spacecraft debris is 1.0 ± 0." A 1.0 odds ratio means 1.0:1.0, or that either possibility is 50% likely. That is, there's an even chance your head will be injured by spacecraft debris or that it will not, <i>if you stay indoors.</i> That does not seem like it could be right, so can someone point me to my error?

<dl><dd>As best I can tell, this is taking odds as a ratio between <i>any</i> two events. Rather than the usual "success&#160;: failure" (or "happens&#160;: doesn't happen"), it's "this scenario happens&#160;: control scenario happens".

<dd>If the guess is correct about the subject being that a possible surprise action by Russia could drop the International Space Station on our heads, or even just its Starlink dish, I think that whether you're indoors or outdoors when its orbit intersects with your coordinates won't affect the risk of head injury.

<p>First timer here, please forgive me if a new discussion subject is inappropriate for the x-axis of the chart being in logarithmic spacing, but I think this warrants considerable discussion by itself (a) because it is a major visual element of the comic, (b) it has received only brief attention to date in explainxkcd discussion.
</p><p>My thoughts: 
</p><p>I am not a statistician. Odds ratios in medicine are usually expressed in a linear manner. Thus, the logarithmic scale for the x-axis is curious. But given the underlying probability of being hit by space debris approaches an asymptote of a near-zero actual probability, perhaps a logarithmic scale is simply correct? It is clearly a deliberate design element, and one that is a major part of the comic. 
</p><p>So those more skilled in stats and explaining xkcd humor will add a few sentences on this matter to the main description! Speculation - perhaps logarithmic is "accurate" within the nonsense assumptions, and so there for consistency? Or perhaps it is a deliberate (by Randall) additional "error" (by the supposed "authors" of the study), and thus the presence of a logarithmic scale compounds the nonsense, as it were, exponentially?
</p>
<dl><dt>Linear correlation?</dt></dl>
<p>I'm wondering how the correlation between time spent outside and chance of getting hit could be anything other than linear. If 1 hour outside gives you X probability, surely 2 hours outside would be 2*X probability. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:FishDawg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:FishDawg (page does not exist)">FishDawg</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FishDawg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:FishDawg (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:37, 7 April 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sort of, but probabilities don't exactly behave like that. On that analysis, given enough time outside, the probability would pass 1 and keep on rising. But a probability of 1 is absolute certainty, so probabilities higher than that are meaningless. I believe the comic is consistent with your assumption that the rate is constant -- the probability of getting hit during an hour is the same no matter which hour it is. It seems reasonable to me, too. Then after 1 hour, your probability of remaining unhit is 0.999999999 or whatever. After 2 hours, it's the probability of remaining unhit in the first hour times the probability of remaining unhit in the second hour, 0.999999999^2. After 3 hours, it's 0.999999999^3, and so on. So the probability of *ever* getting hit actually follows an exponential curve. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.245.173" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.245.173">108.162.245.173</a> 16:32, 8 April 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>(I mean, the rate might not be constant not on a time scale of decades or more. You could go from a society that can't launch spacecraft at all to launching a few and then many, or from a society that just lets 'em fall to one that takes responsibility for moving large pieces into a parking orbit or a controlled deorbit, or from a society that takes responsibility to a charred ruin pocked with circles of radioactive glass, or from that to the rise of Atlantean mages from the tunnels of Shambhala whose mana shall deorbit all things, as the History Channel hath prophesied. But anyway.) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.245.173" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.245.173">108.162.245.173</a> 16:33, 8 April 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>So much confusion about the comic and the explanation read like a bunch of individual comments on top of each other. I took the liberty of rewriting the whole thing (actually, I just wanted to explain Monte Carlo simulations better but then things escalated). I'm fairly certain that I understand the joke of the comic - Randall was simply cramming as much misuse of statistical methods as possible into one "study". The explanation is now rewritten in a pattern of "method-&gt;what method is used for-&gt;how it's misleading here". I'm still not happy with all the details, but I hope the explanation as a whole makes more sense now and that I managed to write understandably. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Rebekka&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rebekka (page does not exist)">Rebekka</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebekka&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Rebekka (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:27, 1 July 2023 (UTC)
