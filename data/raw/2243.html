<p>On December 20, 2019 (2 days after the publication of this comic), the final movie of the "Skywalker saga" of <i>Star Wars</i> films, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>, was officially released to the US. It received a world premiere in Los Angeles on December 16, so there are lots of spoilers online, and also lots of people who want to avoid spoilers.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> has created a flowchart that generates "spoilers" to the film, but as he probably has not seen the film (or, if he has, he doesn't actually want to spoil it for us), all of the so-called spoilers are nonsensical.
</p><p>The formula for each spoiler is as follows: "In this Star Wars movie, our heroes return to take on the First Order and new villain <b>[villain name]</b> with help from their new friend <b>[friend name]</b>. Rey builds a new lightsaber with a <b>[color]</b> blade, and they head out to confront the First Order's new superweapon, the <b>[superweapon name]</b>, a space station capable of <b>[evil plan]</b>. They unexpectedly join forces with their old enemy <b>[character]</b> and destroy the superweapon in a battle featuring <b>[strange event]</b>. P.S. Rey's parents are <b>[character]</b> and <b>[character]</b>".
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Order_(Star_Wars)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:First Order (Star Wars)">First Order</a> is the main antagonist group in the <i>Star Wars</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_sequel_trilogy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars sequel trilogy">sequel trilogy</a> series. In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars: The Force Awakens">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></i>, they use a superweapon in their base, Starkiller Base, to destroy the planetary system housing the headquarters of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Republic_(Star_Wars)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a>, the democratic government which was formed after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Empire</a>'s defeat in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Return of the Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a></i>. 
</p><p>"Building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>" is one of the rites of passage for becoming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jedi">Jedi</a> Knight. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars prequel trilogy">prequel trilogy</a>, new Jedi build lightsabers as an official part of the journey towards Knighthood, and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Trilogy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars Trilogy">original trilogy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> builds a lightsaber between <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i> as part of his training with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Yoda">Yoda</a>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_(Star_Wars)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rey (Star Wars)">Rey</a> has used the lightsaber that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a> made and used (which Luke also used when he was a new Jedi) for the first two movies of the sequel trilogy, and so it would be thematically appropriate for her to build her own prior to the trilogy's final entry.  Most Jedi's lightsabers are either blue or green, with a few notable exceptions (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_Windu" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mace Windu">Mace Windu</a>'s purple lightsaber signifies his incredible combat prowess).  Kyber crystals are aligned with the Light Side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Force">the Force</a>, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sith">Sith</a> must overpower and "bleed" their crystals before they will function for them, which causes their distinctive red color.  Having a lightsaber of a color other than blue, green, or red is often seen in the <i>Star Wars</i> fandom as a sign of being a "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue"><span style="background: #eef;" title="Warning: TV Tropes. See comic 609.">Mary Sue</span></a>", which is an accusation which has been made of Rey.
</p><p>Another common plot point in <i>Star Wars</i> media is the construction, use, and destruction of a superweapon.  These are inspired by stories and media of World War II, in which militaries sought to find, attack, and destroy critical elements of their enemies' resources and infrastructure, and meanwhile would construct elaborate defenses for themselves.  The attack on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Death Star">Death Star</a> in particular is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chastise" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Operation Chastise">Operation Chastise</a>, the "bouncing bomb" attack on Germany's hydroelectric power plants; Operation Chastise was dramatised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_(book)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Dam Busters (book)">1951 book</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Dam Busters (film)">1955 film</a> <i>The Dam Busters</i>, which was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdb03Hw18M">very thoroughly homaged</a> by <i>A New Hope</i>.  The original trilogy of movies only had two Death Stars, but superweapons quickly became a staple of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_to_other_media" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars expanded to other media">Expanded Universe</a> fiction, to the point that one book had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Han Solo">Han Solo</a> make fun of the Empire's tendency towards building superweapons, proposing such ridiculous names as "Galaxy Destructor" and "Nostril of Palpatine".  Superweapons are common in superhero stories.
</p><p>Redemption and making allies of old enemies is also a common plot point in <i>Star Wars</i>.  Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader, but eventually returned to the Light Side to protect his son, and Han Solo was initially a morally ambiguous character who was eventually convinced to join the Rebellion.
</p><p>Rey, one of the main characters in the sequel trilogy series is an orphan, who was left behind on the planet Jakku as a child. As Rey is Force-sensitive and adept at using a lightsaber, there is much speculation among Star Wars fans as to the identity of her parents. Many major characters in <i>Star Wars</i> have unexpected heritages of great portent, most famously Luke, who was very distressed to learn that Darth Vader did not <i>kill</i> his father, as Obi-Wan had told him, but <i>is</i> his father. In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Wars: The Last Jedi">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a></i>, villain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylo_Ren" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kylo Ren">Kylo Ren</a> tells her that she is the child of "filthy junk traders", but many fans speculate that he was lying to her.
</p><p>The title text refers to the bottom option of the [strange event in battle] section. Apparently Lord Juul (or Darth Juul) is fighting the heroes in the Sith car wash. It is unclear what "flipping the switch" from Regular to Premium would do, but it seems to be beneficial to Darth Juul. A "premium" car wash usually has more features than a regular car wash, e.g. more cleaning brushes, waxing the car, cleaning the tires, etc., so perhaps the premium mode activates additional lightsabers.
</p><p>This is the second false fact generating comic, after <a href="/wiki/index.php/1930:_Calendar_Facts" title="1930: Calendar Facts">1930: Calendar Facts</a>.

<p>who said that the rise of skywalker would be released two days before the publishing date after stating that it's going to be released on the twentieth?

</p><p>For a less US-centric view, the movie was released officially in France and Norway (and probably also other countries) already on the 18.12. (that is December 18). So "On December 20, 2019 [...], the final movie [...] will be released." should say "[...] will be released in the US."<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.134.220" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.134.220">162.158.134.220</a> 12:01, 19 December 2019 (UTC)

</p><p>Is darth sebelius a reference to the sibelius composing software?
</p>
<dl><dd>I would think the Sibelous software (1993-present) would instead be a definite reference to the Finnish composer (1865-1957) already part-posited as a possible influence for the Darth.  Although I'd probably defer that suggestion in favour of the politician (1948-present, in direct politics until 2014?) even if I'd actually never heard of them from this side of The Pond. Still, there are weirder connections, so who knows? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.158.93" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.158.93">162.158.158.93</a> 20:18, 21 December 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Please clarify the reference to Rey as a "Mary Sue."  The linked article says that the only agreed on meaning for the term is that it is derogatory.  Other than that, it appears to mean different things to different people.  So it's inclusion here does not help explain the comic.  What is it about Rey that gave her that label.  Is it that she is not canon?  Is it that she is overpowered?  Probably better to just remove the Mary Sue jargon, and say whatever it is they say about those with other colored light sabers directly.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.77" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.77">108.162.246.77</a> 01:45, 22 December 2019 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> While I'm not sure about Rey being entirely a Mary-Sue (in my mind an 'author avatar' character - whether or not a prime protagonist or ascending sidekick, they're just too competent for the role and often a Mcguffin baker), she definitely has more than a little plot-armour (and plot-weapon-skill) that I <i>hope</i>, when I see the filmm (within a week, by current plans), bodes for something other than 2xrnd(trader(junk)) as patentage. Or something else that's actually awesome to get round that without being <i>deus ex</i>.  But by dint of Windu's <i>actor</i> having been asked what colour of weapon he wanted (then him having requested what he did and then being granted it, - which might not have gone that far with less imaginative or influential actors) I'd count that as a very Mary-Sue-like thing, even if the rest of the badassness of that particular Jedi (the tone written prior to the resulting casting of the badass actor to fit) was just standard Major Supporting Character/Lancer fare.  But just my musings, nothing official... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.158.179" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.158.179">162.158.158.179</a> 13:07, 22 December 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'm considering going through the table and adding a note for whether each thing is actually in Star Wars. would that be a good idea? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.141.136" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.141.136">172.68.141.136</a> 06:48, 22 December 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>"Triggering the end credits before the movie is done" is a reference to the "Credits Warp" category in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Speedrun">video game speedrunning</a>. Where a normal speedrun aims to clear the final level and/or defeat the final boss as fast as possible, a "Credits Warp" aims to gain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arbitrary code execution">arbitrary code execution</a> and trigger the end credits without finishing the game. The most famous example is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/9cBIgCy27JI">Super Mario World in 45 seconds</a>. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.77.62" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.77.62">141.101.77.62</a> 14:24, 23 December 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I think the mouseover text is a reference to this scene in "Space Balls": <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOAc5yt218">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOAc5yt218</a>  ("Space Balls" is a satire of several films, including the original "Star Wars" trilogy.)  In the "Space Balls" scene, the bad guys are using a robot to vacuum all the air out of the atmosphere of the planet.  The bad guys have the upper hand until the good guys are able to flip the switch on the vacuum cleaner.  "She's gone from 'suck' to 'blow'" is a fairly famous line in the movie.  I don't know enough "Star Wars" to understand the reference, but if you flip a car wash from "regular" to "premium" I assume the bristles/lightsaber blades would spin faster. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mattj256&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mattj256 (page does not exist)">Mattj256</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattj256&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mattj256 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:07, 23 December 2019 (UTC)
