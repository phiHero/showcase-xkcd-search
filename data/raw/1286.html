<p>Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password. But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.neurosecurity.com/articles/security/passwd.pdf">Password Security: A Case History</a> in 1978. In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hash function">hash function</a>, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex. They also pioneered the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Salt (cryptography)">a "salt"</a> which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://security.blogoverflow.com/2011/07/a-tour-of-password-questions-and-answers/">A tour of password questions and answers</a> for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.
</p><p>Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversibly encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt. This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.
</p><p>In particular, Adobe used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Triple DES">Triple DES</a>, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used, but they used it improperly. It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result. Therefore, two passwords starting with "12345678" would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.
</p><p>Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be "compromised" by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints "Big Apple", "Twin Towers" and "If you can make it there" is probably "New York" or a simple variation on that. The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle. These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Edward Snowden">Edward Snowden</a>, as discussed at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://7habitsofhighlyeffectivehackers.blogspot.com/2013/11/can-someone-be-targeted-using-adobe.html">7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?</a>.
</p><p>The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/how-an-epic-blunder-by-adobe-could-strengthen-hand-of-password-crackers/">uses a different format</a>, and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.
</p><p>As mentioned on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/">http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/</a> the data in the comic isn't real and contains a hidden message. If the "user password" hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:
</p>
<pre>ThiswasnotagooduseofyourtimeButthenagainitwasprobablynotagooduseofmytimeeith
erAndyethereweareXOXOXOLetsLiveHereInThisTinySecretEncodedTextWorldForever==</pre>
<p>More readable:
</p>
<pre>This was not a good use of your time
But then again it was probably not a good use of my time either
And yet here we are
XOXOXO
Lets Live Here In This Tiny Secret Encoded Text World Forever==</pre>
<p>E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: <tt>python2 -c "print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')"</tt>
</p><p>The last letter "r" is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from "g" to "v" produces the same binary data.

<p>The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: <a href="/wiki/index.php/792" class="mw-redirect" title="792">Black Hat's trouble with what to do with stolen passwords</a>. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.
</p><p>Soon after this comic was published, the most common 1000 passwords were actually compiled into <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://zed0.co.uk/crossword/">a set of 10 interactive online crosswords</a>, inspired by the comic.
</p><p>The title itself is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cryptic crossword">cryptic crosswords</a>.

<p>Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like "0" (number zero) for "O" (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct. Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.

<dl><dd>Sexy earlobes might have something to do with Ferengi, but they didn't appeared in TOS. 141.101.99.214's idea is better. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 11:42, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>OK, we know that "sexy earlobes" and "best TOS Episode" are the same for the first eight character, but differ after that, while "best TOS" and "sugarland" are the same after the first 8 characters.  So, my guesses are&#160;: Best TOS episode: "Charlie X"; "Sexy Earlobes": Someone with the first name of "Charlie"; "Sugarland": some city in Texas (perhaps "HoustonTX") <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:JamesCurran&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JamesCurran (page does not exist)">JamesCurran</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:JamesCurran&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:JamesCurran (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:51, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Note that you should not ever use cipher in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Block cipher mode of operation">ECB (electronic codebook)</a> mode, i.e. encrypt each block separately and independently, but use chaining. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:JakubNarebski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JakubNarebski (page does not exist)">JakubNarebski</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:JakubNarebski" title="User talk:JakubNarebski">talk</a>) 12:15, 4 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> And for passwords you shouldn't be using a cipher at all, but rather a hash function.  (Or a cipher in one of the approved hash constructions, if you must.) And really you shouldn't be using a standard hash function, but be following best practices for passwords instead: salting the hash, using a *slow* hash function, etc. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:22, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Hmm, i'm rather confused about the last few on the list though. Assumedly the password for "he did the mash, he did the" would be "monster mash", but that would leave "purloined" with a password of either "monsterm" or "monster ". which doesn't make much sense. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.240.18" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.240.18">108.162.240.18</a> 13:47, 4 November 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>Somehow I've missed out on this issue until this comic alerted me to it, but: once a few passwords are correctly guessed, does that make it straightforward to recover the encryption key, and then be able to decrypt <b>all</b> of them? ‚Äî<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Scs (page does not exist)">scs</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Scs (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:50, 4 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> Answering my own question: not really straightforward, no.  3DES is still pretty strong, and what knowing a few passwords gives you is a known-plaintext attack, which helps a little, but is by no means a giveaway. ‚Äî<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Scs (page does not exist)">scs</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Scs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Scs (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:00, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>No, for calculating the encryption key of Triple DES, there is no real benefit in knowing million passwords, you would still need to brute force it. You would need to know at least 2<sup>32</sup> different passwords to make it easier but you can't do that with the leaked file (there are about 30 times less of them and moreover many of them are not unique). <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Sten" title="User:Sten"><b>S<small>TEN</small></b></a> <small>(<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Sten" title="User talk:Sten">talk</a>)</small> 16:08, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Based on the Water-3 Pokemon hint, the only possibilities of more than 8 characters are tentacool, tentacruel, barbaracle, crawdaunt, carracosta, clauncher, and clawitzer.

<dd> Assuming Randall has constructed this comic to have a unique answer, it can't end in r because then the clue would be ambiguous (could be clauncher or clawitzer). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:53, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> Some of these can be ruled out; it's very unlikely to be a Generation VI Pok√©mon (Barbaracle, Clauncher and Clawitzer) as this has only just come out and someone would have had to set up their pasword within the last few weeks. And the Pok√©mon that are also in the Water-1 group are probably more likely to be thought of as Water-1 than Water-3 (Crawdaunt and Carracosta). This only leaves Tentacool and Tentacruel as longer than 8 letter Water-3 only Pok√©mon that have been known of for a reasonable length of time; and Tentacool is no one's favourite, as the annoying multitude of them that show up whenever you try to Surf anyway makes them as reviled as Zubats in caves, if not moreso.&#160;:P Of course, the password need not be simply the Pok√©mon's name alone. "SexyShellder" "Cloyster1987" "Misty'sStarmie"...

<dl><dd> No, I mean, "an answer of this form", not ALANALDA exactly.  The Edgar Allan / Alan Alda congruence is tasty, but I can't make it work.  ALLANPOE works as an answer for "Purloined" but that makes something like ALLANPOET the answer to "he did the MASH" (CRAWDAUNT is then the pokemon).  But that's misspelling Alda's name for the MASH clue, doesn't quite work.  There's also JAMIEFARR (Cpl Klinger) as a better answer to "he did the MASH" but then that makes JAMIEFAR the answer to "purloined" and I can't plausibly make that work.  ALLANARBUS is another M*A*S*H actor, but that doesn't work at all.

<p>In crossword puzzles, a clue ending in -ed (like 'purloined') is most commonly a hint that the answer ends in 'ed'. Cross referencing that with the Pokemon clue, the solution for "he did the MASH" becomes a nine or ten letter answer ending in:  -edl, -edel, -edle, -edt, or -edta (excluding -edr due to non-uniqueness), with ......edle looking the most "English-y" to me.

Order will be more or less what they are (I see the wide boxes as, in order, 1, 57, 10, Sheen, and X, with the 8 char boxes as Matthias, Password, Judith15, Charlie, and HoustonT).  The next 5 are odd -- I'm not sure if we repeat the alpha/obvious password 5 times, or it's 5 chars long (abcde) and one per box.  The last set is still under discussion, of course. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.28" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.28">108.162.221.28</a> 00:20, 5 November 2013 (UTC)

Frankenstein did the Monster Mash in the cartoon for the song. That leads to a Pokemon card ending in 'tein' and 'frankens' for the hint Purloined. I could not find a Pokemon card that ended in 'tein' nor could I link 'frankens' with Purloined. I ran 'frankens' through Google Translate but found nothing. Also, it's the same password for the "monster mash" hint and the entry with no password hint so I think it's an obvious password (something someone can recall without a hint). Frankenstein fits that part but not the other ones. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.50.222" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.50.222">173.245.50.222</a> 03:35, 5 November 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Working Backwards</dt></dl>
<p>I'm attempting to take a different tact, by trying to find the key itself.  I'm assuming its something easy to guess.  I've tried the top 100 Adobe passwords (you can get them <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt">here</a>) using the following bash script (testing the word "matthias", as this one seems pretty certain):
</p><p><code>
while read p; do echo -n $p\: &amp;&amp; echo -n "matthias" | openssl enc -e -des-ede3 -nosalt -nopad -pass pass:$p | xxd -p; done &lt; passwords.txt
</code>
</p><p>For this to work, I pre-processed the top 100 passwords file with:
</p><p><code>
cat adobe-top100.txt | cut -c51- &gt; passwords.txt
</code>
</p><p>‚Ä¶and then trimmed the cruft with a text editor (leading text paragraph and table headers).  So far no luck; perhaps someone with more time on their hands can try some obvious XKCD-related passwords (I've tried XKCD, xkcd, xkcd.com, randall, rmunroe, encryptic, and Encrytic) and see if the encrypted version(s) match up with what we have here. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Yaztromo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yaztromo (page does not exist)">Yaztromo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Yaztromo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Yaztromo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:27, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I should mention that I've also tried OpenSSL's des-ede mode and des-ecb, as Im not sure if Randall used one, two, or three key mode.  I'm also assuming the key has been generated from the password using OpenSSL's default key generation method, any of with I suppose could be incorrect. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Yaztromo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yaztromo (page does not exist)">Yaztromo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Yaztromo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Yaztromo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:39, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Nice work.  Note that the puzzle is very specific about using "block mode 3-DES" (usually called "ECB").  DES keys are actually 56 bits; each of the 8 bytes has odd parity (the number of 1 bits is odd).  From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">wp</a>, "Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity."  As a wild guess, I'd suggest that, if Randall chose a readable 8-ASCII-character passphrase, he also selected only characters that would make the parity bit zero (so that the result was ASCII).  That is, <code>[ #%&amp;)*,/12478;=&gt;@CEFIJLOQRTWX[]^abdghkmnpsuvyz|]</code>. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:34, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Uh, hold one.  Read the "Explanation" section above.  It's clear that the hashes are not real, so brute-forcing the key isn't going to work. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:48, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Just to note, there are actually three options for keys in TripleDES:  having three independent keys (K1, K2, K3), having two independent keys (K1, K2, K1), or using a single key (K1, K1, K1).  When run in ECB mode, OpenSSL calls these <b>des-ede3</b> and <b>des-ede</b> for options 1 and 2 (option 3 is for backwards compatibility with DES, and can be run using just <b>des-ecb</b>).  See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES#Keying_options">Triple DES - Keying Options</a> for details.  In addition, the password and the key are two different entities -- typically the password is run through a keying algorithm first (commonly <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> for 3DES), so there is no need to select password characters based on parity patterns.

<dl><dd> It's a good connection.  Maybe we should reorganize the discussion and start a list of "interesting ideas we can't quite make work" in the hopes that someone else has an insight.  Edgar Allan / Alan Alda, Pickett / "Pick it", Klinger / Kingler, etc.  Most of these are just manifestation of the human brain's ability to find patterns even in random coincidence, of course, but one of them might be on the right track. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:23, 5 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Just quick thoughts. 
I feel like Cpl klinger and the water type kingler is too solid a connection to ignore even though I can't really use it. 
Kingler was owned in the series by Ash. 
Ash is a three letter word and the last three letters of the phrase monstermash. 
Monsterm=8 letters so the first block  ash=3 letters in the second block. 
Monsterm is about the monster.com thing, therefore purloined. It's a double reference, the .co has been purloined from the purloined website. 
Then blastoise -3, or rather blastois3 - 3 (mocking the common password meme of replacing letters with numbers) 
So the last password, which is super hard to guess and well chosen even with the clue is, blastoisash?   It's a feasibly memorable password that would not be quickly forgotten by a pokemon fan while still being hard to guess. 
Can you think of a way to check it? Maybe go into the old command line xkcd and try it as a password?

<dl><dd> That's really a stretch. ".co is purloined from monster.com?" really? The answer will be far more obviously correct... once we figure it out.

<dl><dt>another quick idea for monster mash</dt></dl>
<p>It could be deflection. Maybe whoever put it in was paranoid. Or just dumb. Or who knows.
</p><p>But, there is a pokemon that's in the monster/water(-1) hybrid group called Marshtomp.
</p><p>Monster mash, mashed (ie anagrammed) can give us all but the P out of that... which is fine, as it's a 9-letter name.
</p><p>Thus we have E, N and S left over (and indeed a further T, H, E), which could become overall, e.g, Marshtomens (...Marshtomethens? Or w/e), which you can split up as you like to represent something which has been stolen (personally). Possibly in german slang or something. It doesn't have to be a direct thesaurus link, it could well be complete misdirection (on Randall's behalf, or that of his notional Adobe user), same as for the pokemon.
</p><p>And for the pokemon itself, it could well be "Marshtomp3"&#160;;)
</p><p>Also, don't forget about reversed words and so-on.
</p><p>Heck, I've used very personal and/or random things (like, maybe two or three people in the world may recognise it in connection with me, and it's not online, at least not anywhere it can be found - basically it's just in my head and dies with me), reversed, with numbers substituting random characters, as passwords before. That covers each individual base in just one PW...
</p><p>Now we just have to start feeding the guesses into a hash engine and try to figure out, maybe brute force, what the original key was. Knowing almost all of the other answers already makes this far, far easier for those who may have the facility to run the tests already. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.213" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.213">141.101.99.213</a> 14:54, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> This is not a real excerpt from the password file, this is a puzzle which Randall made up.  Therefore, the answer to the last group will not be random, and it will not be a stretch.  It will be obvious (as obvious as the previous ones)... once we figure out the catch. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:23, 5 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

Possibly Randall put them in and was feeding us clues (so <i>MASH</i> the book or movie, and <i>Purloined</i> a title such as Poe's).

<ul><li>About the Pokemon, is it possible everyone's ignoring a much simpler explanation? Every Pokemon game begins with a choice of one of the three starter Pokemon, each of which have an evolutionary line of three Pokemon. In first gen, if your "favorite [is] water [from the] 3 Pokemon", then you'll be using Squirtle, followed by Wartortle and Blastoise. 2nd gen: Totodile, Croconaw, Feraligatr. 3rd gen: Mudkip, Marshtomp, Swampert. 4th gen: Piplup, Prinplup, Empoleon. Perhaps the answer uses one of these, or some combination of them? --Anon 08:57, 6 November 2013 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>I think it is not coincidence that it is the last one that you can't solve.  It may be an experiment by Randall to see if people can find a solution for a puzzle that doesn't make any sense.  That said, if it does have a solution, it should not be "monstermash" since that is too close to the clue.  If that was the password, everyone could guess it easily from the clue.  It has to be one level "removed" from those words, guided by the clues for the matching passwords.  The point of the post was that using unsalted crypt in the passwords allows you to combine clues, right? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.201" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.201">108.162.219.201</a> 13:42, 6 November 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Not an answer, but maybe an approach:  Look at it from the "what piece of information is Randall trying to tell us?" angle.  In the first few puzzles, he teaches us the rules of the game.  We disambiguate clues by later ones, which we can only do because of the missing salts. For example, the "name and jersey number" just tells us the format of the answer to the previous clue about Judith 15:10.  Otherwise, there would have been no way to guess that exact string without the space and colon. Also, "Charlie X" and "Charlie Sheen" demonstrate that spaces are used in a "fair" way.  I would not expect a trailing space on a password, for example.  So what about the Pokemon then?  The first half of the crypt for the Pokemon isn't used anywhere else.  The easiest interpretation I can come up with is that this is just trying to restrict the common second part of the word to letters from the list of Water-3 Pokemon.  Let's assume it wasn't made very difficult, so take just 'el', 'le', and 'l' from the Water-3-only group on bulbapedia.  Then the puzzle is this:
</p>
<pre> something related to 'monster mash': 8 letters plus the ending 'el', 'le', or 'l'
 something related to 'purloined' or related to 'letter': the same 8 letters, minus the ending
 pokemon: completely unrelated, just chosen to have a well known list of 9 or 10 letter words to restrict search space for first line
</pre>
<p>I suck at crosswords, but can someone solve this restated version? There can't be that many 8 letter words that also make a word with 'el', 'le', or 'l' added to them? 15:23, 6 November 2013 (UTC)  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.201" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.201">108.162.219.201</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.219.201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.219.201 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd> Not to insult your reasoning, which is entirely correct, but I believe your restatement is *exactly* the puzzle that (reasonable) people have been working on (and failing to solve) since Monday.  As a long-time mystery hunter, I'd like to suggest the opposite: the continued failure to find some reasonable solution to the puzzle as stated above implies that *at least one* of the assumptions above is wrong.  (For the record, I'd broaden your first to "...related to 'monster mash' or the show/film M*A*S*H", but again, that's the assumption we *have* been making.)  So I'm especially interested in ideas *different* from the above, at this point, although not necessarily throwing out the bathtub, baby and all.  Probably there's a fundamentally different way to read the first clue, or the second, or the third. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:11, 6 November 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Not insulted at all, just glad if I summarized it correctly, since I was late to the party.  Maybe this helps others bootstrap.  As requested, a slightly alternate view for clue 1: the word "mash" may not be part of the answer, since it appears in the clue.  This means the direct answer to the clue is "monster" and has nothing to do with the song at all.  The password could just be the name of a monster that is formed from something purloined plus an short ending. The endings we're already considering make nice monster names.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.198" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.198">108.162.219.198</a> 19:54, 6 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Finding the probability of a collision amounts to the birthday problem. Assuming the hash function gives all 2^64 hash values with equal probability and there are 153 million unique message blocks (probably right within an order of magnitude), we have:</dd>

<dd> So the probability of a hash collision from different passwords is still quite low, even with such a large number of passwords. So it's worth assuming that all the identical hash blocks are from the same message, and keep looking for the poke-mash password.</dd>

<dl><dd> This get's my vote. There's no reason for the "mash" password to be repeated twice in the puzzle with no clue for one of them except to say "this is a commonly used password" (as shown by the abc and password1 entries). Common password with an l (or el etc.) missing from the end, a purloined letter(!), plus "mash" as a clue is oblique but not crazyily so <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.223" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.223">141.101.99.223</a> 17:37, 7 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I agree with the repetition part.

It is actually more common, but at least it is on the list. I also think it is by far the best fit if choosing only from that list.  Also, maybe Randall used another source material where it is less common than 'abc.' <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.158" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.158">173.245.52.158</a> 13:13, 8 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I think this is the best wrong answer yet. That is, I don't see how you can plausibly clue "ASDFGHJK" with "purloined" (that is, the hint doesn't work on its own, it requires the rest of the puzzle to make sense at all, which is against the rules of the puzzle).  But it's a good story.  Definitely wrong, but wrong in a really interesting way, and the most interesting wrong answer yet.&#160;;) <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cscott (page does not exist)">Cscott</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cscott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cscott (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:41, 7 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I disagree. Even without the context of the rest of the comic, ASDFGHJKL is such a common password that it makes sense to imagine a hint that simply refers to a variation on it. In the same way, I can imagine someone using "purloined" to hint at a password of PASSWOR. Of course, with only 7 letters that wouldn't work for the comic. You would need a common 9 letter password to make a workable puzzle in the comic, and it's hard to think of anything better than ASDFGHJKL in that context. I appreciate the symmetry of the reference as well, in The Purloined Letter, the trick is that the police are all overthinking things and overlooking the obvious.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.16" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.16">108.162.221.16</a> 21:58, 7 November 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd> I don't like "purloined" as a hint for "ASDFGHJK" one bit ("christmas" [that is, "noel"], "eight home", "elephant sneeze with a holiday", or any number of other phrases would be much better if that's what you were trying to clue), but it is the best thing so far.  Maybe if we pencil it in, Randall will be motivated to let us know what he *really* meant.

<dl><dt>Another theory on last part</dt></dl>
<p>Numbers and dates. Other passwords had numbers, why not this one? 
</p><p>A birthday is an easy thing to remember, so it's bound to be someone's password. So lets say a birthday was August 25, 1962. One can write that as august2562, which just so happens to be when Monster Mash was released, as per Wikipedia. In addition, August is quite similar to C. Auguste Dupin, from The Purlioned Letter. Lastly, one can add the Pokedex number of the Pokemon to the end of its name, but Poliwrath62 is too long, and is a water 1 Pokemon, not water 3.
</p><p>This theory doesn't fit perfectly, but I haven't seen it posted yet. Maybe it'll give someone that eureka moment...<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.128.188" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.128.188">199.27.128.188</a> 10:11, 7 November 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>On the "purloined" and "monster mash" things: this is an incomplete theory but might give someone else an idea. Poe's "The Purloined Letter" contains this line: "He is the monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius." So perhaps the "purloined" clue is a reference to this line somehow. "Monstrum horrendum" is Latin for "horrendous monster" (although in Latin "monster" technically means "something to be pointed out and marvel at"). So if the password is "monsterm", this could be a misspelling of "monstrum"; if it's "monster " it could be a translation, though that begs the question as to why it ends with a space. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Darthkiwi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Darthkiwi (page does not exist)">Darthkiwi</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Darthkiwi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Darthkiwi (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:50, 7 November 2013 (UTC)

From the wikipedia page about said dance, a slightly modified version of it was one of the dances that people danced to the Monster Mash.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.35" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.35">108.162.219.35</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.219.35&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.219.35 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

</p><p>One technique for creating strong passwords is to take the first letter of each word in a passage from a book/movie quote/song/etc. as seen at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.mrsware.com/2/post/2013/06/passwords-revisited.html">http://www.mrsware.com/2/post/2013/06/passwords-revisited.html</a> - "I was working in the lab late one night" would turn into "iwwitllon". If we take the next lyrics from the monster mash after "he did the", we get 'mmhdtmiwags'. The first eight words of The Purloined Letter would spell 'apjadoge'. Not sure how helpful this is.
</p><p>Another thought is that in the story of The Purloined Letter, the letter is hidden in plain sight. Also, the story starts out with "Nihil sapientiae odiosius acumine nimio" - Nothing is more hateful to wisdom than excessive cleverness, which may be relevant here.
</p><p>Finally, I was thinking about punctuation. "mon*m#" could be pronounced like "mon-star-m-hash". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.130.146" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.130.146">199.27.130.146</a> 23:02, 7 November 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>It's also possible that Monster Mash means combining (mashing) the names of two Pokemon.  I believe you guys have only been looking at single pokemon names.  Regarding Purloined, could that word be the opposite mashup?  So a Pokemon called (I'm making this up, don't hate on me) Purfect and another one named Charloined could mash into Purloined or Charfect.  <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mirrordude&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mirrordude (page does not exist)">Mirrordude</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mirrordude&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mirrordude (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd> I don't think that is 'legal' in the rules that everyone is assuming for this game.  Note the (simulated) user who picked the pokemon clue is unaware that someone else used monster mash in their clue. This is addressed in more detail above. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.158" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.158">173.245.52.158</a> 13:00, 8 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p><b>Not 1, but 3 Pokemon</b>
</p><p>What if the Pokemon clue wasn't a single favorite from the water-3 group, but a favorite group of three water type Pokemon?  This is less intuitive from the hint, but do people really pick out favorites from egg groups rather than types?  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8">173.245.54.8</a> 01:41, 8 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> For example, "PokeBroKing" would represent a family of three water Pokemon (Slowpoke, Slowbro, Slowking), and "ING" would be the second hash to use with MonsterMash and the blank hint. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8">173.245.54.8</a> 03:18, 8 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p><b>Two Word Monsters?</b>
</p><p>What if the most simple derivation summarized above is correct, but with two minor changes:
</p>
<pre> 1) he did the... refers to 'monster' not 'monster mash' since 'mash' appears in the clue (I asked about this above, but nobody commented)
    note that this needs to be a password that you wouldn't guess if you don't also have the purloined clue, so not the word 'monster' or 'monster mash' itself
 2) assume there is a space making two words in the first 8 characters of the answer to this clue
</pre>
<p>Then the search for 8 character words for 'purloined' would actually be the search for 8 character phrases, like so:
</p>
<pre> purloined -&gt; letter -&gt; 'post man'
 monster -&gt; 'post manle' (ok, that's not a monster, but for the correct 'purloined' phrase it would be)
</pre>
<p>This should fix the problem where you can't add short endings to 8 character words and make another word.  I think it is easier to add these endings to shorter words.  I also like the form of this puzzle, because it would be a logical difficulty progression after the 'Charlie X' thing above.

</p><p>I think you're on the wrong track.  The answer for the last one could be "Password|Smash" or "Password|Mash" (rhymes with MonsterMash) capitalization unknown, of course. "OmastarS|mash" or "Omastar |Smash" for the Pokemon.  Purloined, of course would be the "Password" itself, self-referential.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.23" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.23">108.162.219.23</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.219.23&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.219.23 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p>
<dl><dt>Who did the mash?</dt></dl>
<p>It's right in the lyrics: "my monster". The obvious corresponding answer to the Pok√©mon clue is to prepend the Pok√©dex number to the name, eg, "099kingler". It could also be, say, "99 kingler" or "91cloyster", which is unfortunate because we'd prefer a unique solution. Even sadder is that this leaves us with "my monst" for the password with the purloined clue, and that really just makes no sense at all. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.38" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.38">108.162.219.38</a> 22:55, 8 November 2013 (UTC)

</p>
<dl><dd>The boxes are just what people have been doing with the fact that each block represents up to 8 characters. You'll notice the rectangles made up of smaller boxes contain 8 boxes. These are only for the passwords which contain two blocks (thus having 9-16 characters).

</p><p>Rob and pick are both synonyms of steal, and the guy who wrote the monster mash is robert pickett.  So purloined could be "rob pick" and the other clue just "rob pickett".  This doesn't seem to fit with any of the pokemon clues mentioned, but since I know nothing about pokemon mayber there's a way to make it work? -- starwed <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.19" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.19">108.162.216.19</a> 19:16, 11 November 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> I like the idea of some permutation of Robert Pickett.  I'm sure the ending can be used with some Pokemon, provided the region number is added.  What bothers me though is that the answer to monster mash is the same as the one above, which makes me think it should be a common phrase, not a name.  But maybe there's a way to mess with Bob's name to turn it into a common phrase. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.8">173.245.54.8</a> 01:18, 13 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>ducklett is a water pokemon belonging to egg group water 1 (so not completely fitting) his pokedex number is 580. disregarding the fact that it's water 1 and not 3 it could be 580ducklett. but even then we don't know for sure if we need a regional or national pokedex number. most pokemon (if not all) appear in more than one pokedex, and they are numbered differently in each one. so it could also be 086ducklett, #86ducklett, 153ducklett, or 127ducklett, along with the aforementioned 580 ducklett. so this would not be unambiguous. and prefixing a pokemon with it's pokedex number means there would be more than one solution to the puzzle. i now think that this is not the correct approach. i also really hope this isn't like a bait and switch, or some other trick to fool us into believing there is a solution, while in fact there is none. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.231.53" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.231.53">108.162.231.53</a> 22:04, 11 November 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> In your edit summary you say, "it's a move, not a character", and I'm assuming you are referring to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Meteor_Mash_(move)">Meteor Mash</a>.  But how is that a "fav water-3" pokemon (move)?  It's *generation 3*, but it's a steel type move.  There's nothing 'water' about it.  Further, "monster " is still not an acceptable answer for the clue "purloined", and the previous "Charlie " answers have indicated that spaces count.

<p>EVERY hint and password refers to hackers or hacking [Try googling hacker ___], even possible alternatives such as SHEEN (actor's name) or HARPER (character name). 'Fav of 12 apostles' -- 'hacker 12' reveals news articles about a 12-year old Canadian boy convicted of hacking, and 'hacker apostle' sends you to "The 13th Apostle," an apparently terrible novel about a teenaged hacker.
</p><p>EVERYTHING is related. 'Apostle' helped us figure out 'weather vane sword' (which was hidden, but a POEm was left hinting at where). '57' seems random - until you PURLOIN 1 from it (l and 1 often interchanged either purposely or accidently) and end up with 56 - and the 56th most common password on the list was asdfghjkl. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Eve&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Eve (page does not exist)">Eve</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Eve&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Eve (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:24, 13 November 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>Fav water-3 Pokemon has to be tentacool. It fits the format tentacoo l using the purloined l from asdfghjk l. Tentacool is (was&#160;?) a well-known Pokemon hacker, and tentacool references LaughingSquid and its 'Chief Tentacle" Scott Beale. Finally, tentacool's number is 72, and if you add the numerals in the top half of the passwords (1, 57, 15, 10) and then subtract the numbers-represented by letters in the bottom half of the passwords (x = roman 10 and l = 1) you get 72.

</p><p>Sorry. I‚Äôll slow down and back up, and I apologize in advance if this is too much or too verbose.
The seeming randomness of both the hints/passwords chosen and their arrangement on the physical page bugged me, especially given the ‚Äúgreatest crossword puzzle‚Äù claim. Great crossword puzzles aren‚Äôt random; they‚Äôre thematic, amazingly inter-connected, and self-validating. 
The subject of the puzzle seemed to indicate its theme, so I started googling ‚Äòhacker ___,‚Äù inserting random words from the hints, and then from the passwords themselves as they were deciphered. The results were kinda amazing and very educational. As I said earlier, everything in the puzzle is related to hackers/hacking, even things you‚Äôd think couldn‚Äôt possibly be. Hacker Sheen, for example, led me to a Sheen News Network story on ‚ÄúHackers being treated like terrorists,‚Äù which discussed the Auerheimer and Hammond cases. So, general thematic relevance established, though ‚Äò57' still bothered me...
As did the physical arrangement of the puzzle. Why was ‚Äòfavorite of 12 apostles‚Äô several lines away from ‚Äúweather vane sword‚Äù when these two clues self-validated? Why was ‚ÄòJudith15' so markedly out of alignment with both of the hints that produced it, which were themselves separated? Questions like these eventually led me to believe that we should look for connections and validations within the puzzle as a whole, not just in consecutive or nearly-consecutive clues.
Which brought me back to ‚Äò57,‚Äô and the last group of hints/passwords that seemed to have no connection to any other hints/passwords and no validation within the puzzle...and it finally dawned me that the reason this bugged me so much was that asdfghjkl was the 56th rather than 57th entry in the list of common passwords, and my first thought was Why couldn‚Äôt it have been 56, and my second thought was But if you take away 1 then it is, and the Eureka moment came when I realized that ‚Äòtake away‚Äô is a synonym of ‚Äòpurloined‚Äô and  l and 1 are often interchanged either accidentally or purposefully and 57 - 1 = 56. 
So then I looked up Tentacool‚Äôs number, and looked at all the other numbers in the puzzle, to see if they would somehow produce 072. My heart sank when I realized that 1 + 57 + 15 + 10 = 83, and that even subtracting the purloined l/1 didn‚Äôt get me there, but then I realized that if the x were a roman numeral 10, and it too was subtracted, then the result was 72 and, again, internal validation of an answer.
Farfetched? -Sure. Too great a stretch? -Perhaps. Ingenious and beautiful? - Absolutely. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Eve&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Eve (page does not exist)">Eve</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Eve&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Eve (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:41, 14 November 2013 (UTC)
