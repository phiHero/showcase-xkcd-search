<p>This comic parodies the difference between 'accuracy' and 'precision' with a table. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Accuracy and precision">Accuracy and precision</a> are common concepts to be encountered in the scientific field and often students have issues with the differences between them. Accuracy concerns whether a statement is true, while precision concerns how detailed it is; it is possible for a statement to be one but not the other. The comic explores this concept by comparing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, former President of the United States, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cat">cats</a>. Confusingly, he measures different statistics of both Barack Obama and cats (sometimes measuring them in terms of cats) leaving the unwary reader even more confused.
</p><p>Being precise is typical of calculations that roll out an excess of significant digits, often in the form of trailing decimals. Precision is lowered by using more rounded figures, or merely being comparative, but largely unaffected by whether the original values used were accurate or even correct. Accuracy is a cumulative function of the accuracy given to the intermediate values used for any calculation, and can be degraded by using figures that are themselves in some way inaccurate or imprecise. One part of confusion between the two is because being too precise usually decreases accuracy.
</p><p>The numbers mentioned in the top row (high precision) of the table all use exactly the same digits, dictating that a full five digits of <i>precision</i> are used in them all. The most "valid" or correct value is a number that's very accurate and precise (see table). For the medium accuracy the number is an anagram of the 1st entry, giving a value that is reasonable but would be overly exact, whilst the low accuracy number is just a repeat of the first entry's digits with a shifted decimal but clearly at the wrong scale, as Randall could have shifted the decimal point one further place to the left to be closest to the true measurement. Instead, he replaces the thousands separator with the decimal point, perhaps for the visual pun.
</p><p>The title text compares Obama's and cats' enjoyment of playing with cardboard boxes. While cats are known to do this,<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> we don't know whether Obama does.
</p><p>The day prior to the publication of this comic (November 8, 2022) was election day in the United States, so Randall may have been remembering Barack Obama's presidency at this time.

Also a human's mass can vary by a few pounds in a small amount of time as meals are consumed, resources are used in metabolism and wastes are eliminated, and thus this may be overly precise due the margin of error in both the mass of cats and the mass of Mr. Obama. In 2016, Obama was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/obama-medical-exam-loses-weight">officially reported</a> to weigh 175 lb (79.3787 kg). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+heavy+is+an+average+cat">Google claims that an average cat weighs between 8.8 and 11 lbs</a>, so this statement may be close to accurate.

Coincidentally, Barack Obama is approximately 70 <i>cat</i> feet tall, using the paw size of a house cat to measure his height. Given the number of cat-related facts in the rest of the chart, this could be seen as rather appropriate.

The examinations may have been made at different times of their respective days, with some spinal compression occurring all the time not laid in bed, and his current height is also not publicly recorded; several years of gradual aging could also reduce his posture slightly, or sustaining his fitness (since experiencing the travails of office) may counteract this to a greater or lesser effect.

</p><p>Why is 'Barack Obama is 6'1"' and 'Barack Obama has 4 legs' medium precision?

<dl><dd> OK, I get it. 6'1" means something between 6'0.50" and 6'1.49". For height it's OK, but when counting legs, it seems like a stretch. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tkopec&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tkopec (page does not exist)">Tkopec</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tkopec&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tkopec (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:30, 9 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> The four legs are probably considered to be only medium precise, not because of the number but because of the imprecise term "leg". While humans can walk on all four extremities, thereby using them as legs, the upper two are commonly referred to as arms. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Bischoff" title="User:Bischoff">Bischoff</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Bischoff" title="User talk:Bischoff">talk</a>) 14:54, 9 November 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> (ECed by Bischoff) Plus a person's height (excluding differences to footwear and perhaps hairstyle) varies by an inch or so over the course of a day, as the spine compresses whilst mostly upright (would depend a bit upon your daily activities, but "an inch" or 2-3cm is the typical quoted value, with all the questions about precision <i>as well as</i> accuracy). Within an inch of such a foot-and-inch value is basically between slightly over a percentage point of drift across a continuum of ultimately non-integer values.</dd>
<dd> The number of legs is <i>generally</i> a whole number (perhaps lower-limb amputees could claim "half a leg", but is that for above the knee or below or... that's beyond my wish to define, I would leave it up to the individual amputee to finesse to their own liking) and assigning decimals, even .000(recurring), would be <i>over-</i>precise. A definite plain figure (however inaccurate) being the happy and acceptable medium between that and the vague imprecision (never mind inaccuracy) of the kind in the cell below. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.178.137" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.178.137">172.71.178.137</a> 15:00, 9 November 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That there is confusion over this was a bit of a surprise to me, about 20 years ago, when I worked (as I did for many years) in the outdoor pursuits trade. GPS units would give a 12-character grid reference (1m<sup>2</sup>), but couldn't be relied upon to that level. I would tell people they're more precise than they are accurate, until it became apparent that they were waiting for me to complete the joke they thought I'd begun, as I was so clearly contradicting myself, what with the two words meaning identical things.</dd>

It is so annoying that the US uses . and , to mean the opposite of what most European countries (including Denmark where I live). So when I read this it states that Obama was president less than 3 days (70 hours) but it more than 70000 feet tall.&#160;:-) Of course I now the difference but I have to think about it more than if everyone used the same standard. Also height should use SI units as everyone should&#160;;-) (weight given in number of cats is the new SI unit as far as I know, but don't use inches and feet&#160;;-D ) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 08:17, 10 November 2022 (UTC)

<p>I think Randall missed an opportunity to clarify how high precision can make something inaccurate.  He could have said that Obama is 6’ 1.02173” tall, which would clearly be very precise, and also clearly inaccurate, simply because of the excessive precision. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:John&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:John (page does not exist)">John</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:John&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:John (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:22, 10 November 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Saying 6'1.0278 would have been more in theme, there. And it would be not really more inaccurate (might even be closer to the truth...) but would convey a false precision.</dd>
<dd>Interstingly, when Andrew Waugh measured Mount Everest (before it was so named) he got a diffraction-adjusted figure of 29,000 feet, but decided to announced that it was 29,002 so that it didn't just like a rough figure rounded to the nearest hundred or even thousand feet. This made him the first person to put two feet on the top of Everest!</dd>
<dd>(...The actual error was not bad, given his measurements had to be made from hundreds of miles away. Current official measurements with on-the-spot modern GPS say 29,031.7 feet (for the snow-peak, which is all that Waugh could mention), after 170ish years of (by some estimates, but contested) about a foot of extra height per decade through the continuing techtonic raising of the Himalaya. And any unknown differences in snow-depth. Certainly it was within tens of feet, i.e. a dozen or so metres. With a bit of an error-bar, but not really that big when you consider it...)</dd>
<dd> So, arguably, that case was a deliberately false accuracy to help convey the true precision. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.90.3" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.90.3">172.70.90.3</a> 16:15, 10 November 2022 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>The only thing I can imagine is, that these kinds of numbers happen due to conversions. E.g. 6ft1in would be 185.42cm (according to the first calculator I found), but it is unlikely that 6ft1in was as precise as a cm-value with 2 digits after the decimal point would be. And in the other direction 185cm (which would be the usual precision of a height in m or cm - while 186cm could still be correct as it would be 6ft1in in the "usual precision") would calculate as 6ft and 0.83in --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 10:18, 11 November 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If Obama's height is provided with this much precision, you can assume that the numbers are made up. 0.0278 inches are - in real measure units&#160;;-) - 0.07mm. That's the diameter of a strain of hair. Nobody's height gets measured to that kind of precision. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Kimmerin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kimmerin (page does not exist)">Kimmerin</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimmerin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Kimmerin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:10, 17 November 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I'm not sure the current explanation's claim that 'being too precise usually decreases accuracy' is, er, accurate (or perhaps it's just imprecise). It might be reasonable to claim that increasing precision tends to decrease accuracy relative to the level of precision, but not so much in absolute terms, or even necessarily relative to the size of the thing being measured.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.107.156" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.107.156">141.101.107.156</a> 09:38, 11 November 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think it's badly phrased. The assumed accuracy can be degraded and disadvantageous.</dd>
<dd>For example, to use someone's figures from just above, looking for an individual with a height of 185.42cm might seem to rule out the one that you find is 185.57cm tall, though they are indeed the one initially measured/estimated at 6'1" and would definitely be within an inch or so in this latest attempt to match them.</dd>
<dd>An old phrase that I grew up with is "don't try to be accurate over inaccurate details"  (courtesy of a chemistry teacher, where we frequently used mmol-like measurements in analyses like titrations). The number of articles that say "the probe flew past the asteroid at a distance of about 20 miles (32.187 kilometres) ...", where clearly the accuracy is misleading, especially if the conversion ends up being back-converted by someone else with no idea ("...which is 20.0000746 miles"), and may have come from an <i>original</i> figure actually deliberately pegged at 35km (21.748 miles!), within a few metres or less.</dd>
<dd>Really, you should be taking the level of precision/accuracy inherent in the initial values, preserving the awkward fractions throughout the intermediate steps <i>and</i> converting the inherent ranges by the same process then clearly presenting the final figure to no more exactitude than the initial smudge of "all actual values that would be given by this type of input value", and maybe less. The write-up might be then be realistically "...of around 21¾ miles (35km)", if using a better primary source, or "20 miles (~30km)" in a case of the detail already being likely lost by intermediate chinese-whispers.</dd>
<dd>But this is what confuses people. And how even those that are not confused can confuse others... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.86.10" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.86.10">172.70.86.10</a> 12:16, 11 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It gets even better when different units also use different 0s. So for a persons height we can assume that as 0ft0in and 0cm is the same, 185cm is one order of magnitude more precise than 6ft1in, as it is 3 significant digits vs 2 at the same height. However a persons body temperature in 38°C with 2 significant digits and 311K with 3 is the same level of precision and only .15°C (Or .15K) apart, while 100°F (37.77...°C) is also very close but a bit more precise. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 14:10, 11 November 2022 (UTC)
