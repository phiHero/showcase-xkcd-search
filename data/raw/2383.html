<p>This comic is an update to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1122:_Electoral_Precedent" title="1122: Electoral Precedent">1122: Electoral Precedent</a>, adding "broken precedents" for the US presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. It was published six days after the 2020 election took place, and two days after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_Total_Landscaping_press_conference" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference">most news networks "called" the election</a>, projecting Biden as the winner. The majority of the comic's panels are duplicates from 1122, with the exception of the 2012 panel (modified to show that Obama did in fact break the streak), the 2016 panel (added to reflect the election of Donald Trump), and the two 2020 panels. It continues the theme of pointing out that an arbitrary 'precedent' can always be invoked to predict the outcome of an election. Presidential elections happen rarely enough that each is a unique event, and <i>something</i> is always happening for the first time. Like with the other examples, the precedents mentioned here mix factors that could plausibly impact the election (such as one candidate having been impeached), with precedents that are just a product of time and chance (like a successful challenger having a website).
</p><p>The final two panels again show how, no matter which candidate won in 2020, it would be a 'first' in some way.
</p>
<ul><li> No sitting president who was impeached was even nominated for the office again until Donald Trump. (Only two other US presidents have been impeached. Bill Clinton couldn't run again afterward due to term limits, Andrew Johnson failed to be nominated at the 1868 Democratic Convention.) After the election, it remains true that no impeached president has ever been re-elected. (As of February 2021, Trump is considered a potential candidate for the 2024 election; should he be nominated and win that election, this statement could become false, depending on how exactly one interprets it.)</li>
<li> Prior to the 2020 election, no challenger with a website ever won. This, however, is easily explained by the fact that incumbent presidents usually win, and websites are a fairly new technology. The last time a challenger beat an incumbent was in 1992 before Internet use was widespread. By 1996 that had changed and both the incumbent <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/websites/cg96/">Bill Clinton campaign</a> and the challenger <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dolekemp96.org/main.htm">Bob Dole campaign</a> had websites that look very simple by today's standards. The title text points out that one could just as easily say that incumbents with websites are unbeatable, until that precedent was broken in 2020.</li></ul>
<p>The 2020 election was also precedent-breaking in a few ways that Randall didn't mention:
</p>
<ul><li> At 78, Joe Biden was the oldest president ever on the day of his inauguration.</li>
<li> Biden's running mate Kamala Harris is the first-ever female vice president, first Black vice president, and the first Asian vice president (her parents are from Jamaica and India). She's also the first Democratic vice president from the West.</li>
<li> Biden received over 80 million votes, the highest ever, beating Obama 2008's previous record of just under 69.5 million votes. The second-highest raw vote total was for Trump, with approximately 74.2 million votes, <i>also</i> beating Obama 2008. Turnout as a percentage of the eligible population was the highest in over a century. Unlike the other precedents, however, this one was not an inevitable outcome of a Biden-Harris victory.</li></ul>
<p>Also, Biden is the first president from the state of Delaware, thus he broke the "precedent" that Delawareans can't win. Randall then proceeds to combine these 2 facts to create a new precedent: Only Delawareans can defeat incumbents with a website.

</p><p>Is there some shadow text behind the main text in the 2016 square? I can barely make it out.

<dd> Not only that, but A) while "the votes uncertified by the states" may influence the exact total, they can't make Trump win, B) a Trump victory would require that ALL legal cases are resolved in Trump's favor (depending on uncertified votes) and C) the Republican party asked to Trump to concede victory, meaning that nobody with political experience believes those legal cases have a chance of success. The only unknown point is the result of the EC election, but it is naturally assumed they will vote for the elected candidate.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.55.104" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.55.104">172.69.55.104</a> 08:29, 10 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<p>I don't understand how the statement for 1876 could have been true: if J.Q.

</p>
<dl><dd> Simple: there were more than two candidates. In 1824, there were four candidates who each got over 10% of the vote. That's how Adams could win without the majority, without one of his opponents then having the majority. (In fact, Jackson had the plurality of the votes, but not the majority, but Adams was elected by the House.) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.74" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.74">141.101.98.74</a> 11:30, 10 November 2020 (UTC)

<p>Bad with formatting here, but I updated the bit about precedent to include that Trump's raw vote total (approx 71.5 million, also not yet certified) is <i>also</i> breaking the precedent set by Obama in 2008. Love them or hate them, in this high-turnout election, both major party candidates had record numbers for their raw vote totals. Trump doesn't make it to first place above Obama because Biden makes it to first place above Trump. I didn't look into whether the percentage of eligible population numbers are different, but higher turnout combined with higher population makes breaking that barrier a little easier.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.5" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.5">108.162.238.5</a> 13:02, 10 November 2020 (UTC)

</p><p>Is it just me, or is Randall using this comic as an excuse to throw some shade on Trump? The two squares about Trump are "he has no military experience or political experience" and "he got impeached and then lost."

<dl><dd>By Randall's standards, this "shade" is fairly mild. We already know that Randall is not a fan of Trump. The fact that Trump had no government or military experience, unlike all previous presidents, was well-known.

<dd>If he wanted to throw shade at trump, it could've been something like "No candidate has been elected after admitting on tape to grabbing womens' crotches without consent", not something mild like not coming from a government or military background (which Trump bragged about). --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.78.164" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.78.164">162.158.78.164</a> 17:44, 11 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd>That confused me too for a second, but then I realized what was meant - checkmark is on the claim that is still true after this election ("No president has won after being impeached"), while X is on the one that is no longer true ("No challenger with a website has won"). <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:BytEfLUSh" title="User:BytEfLUSh">BytEfLUSh</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:BytEfLUSh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:BytEfLUSh (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:40, 11 November 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Could someone add this into the explanation? I didn't get this either. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.189.245" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.189.245">172.68.189.245</a> 16:45, 11 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Could also note that Biden is the first Presidential Medal of Freedom holder to be elected to the Presidency. (All other presidents so-honored have been awarded the PMoF after their term in office.)
