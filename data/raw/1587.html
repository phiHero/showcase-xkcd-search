<p>There are various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vegetarianism">vegetarian</a> diets which restrict certain foods for ethical or personal concerns. Real vegetarians do not eat any kind of meat, but some only refrain from eating red meat, although this means they are not true vegetarians. Vegetarianism can go as far as to not eating (or even using) any kind of products coming from an animal (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Veganism">veganism</a>). The comic is a joke on one of the vegetarian rules, namely <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/910-dont-eat-anything-with-a-face">don't eat anything with a face</a></i>. This rule is difficult to follow, because it is subjective whether people think a given animal has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Face">face</a>, causing disagreement about what is allowed and what is forbidden to eat.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> presents a list (see <a href="#Items_on_the_list">details</a> below) of allowed and forbidden food in his diet. For example, he eats meat from typical-looking animals like beef, pork, chicken, and fish. He will also eat plants like fruit, vegetables and grain. But he refuses to eat some of the more odd-looking creatures from the sea like squids, shrimps and oysters. Below the list he explains his rule for what can be eaten: <i>I won't eat something if I have to Google to figure out whether or not it has a face</i>, which is a joke on the disagreements about the <i>don't eat anything with a face</i> rule. The joke is particularly teasing as it allows most (if not all) kinds of meat, which are the most strictly forbidden foods for even the mildest of vegetarians. Randall does not care about food having faces, he is worried apparently only about having to defend the position that some particular food has a face or not. While it's clear, at least to Randall, that a cow has a face and an apple does not, some beings are harder to classify into one of these categories. For Randall this goes for shrimps, oysters and squids; and apparently actual vegetarians also struggle with these creatures, as can be seen in several on-line questions (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080613194541AAwlN90">1</a>).
</p><p>The title text gives another rule that also would make these same three omissions. This rule is about not eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> (animals without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vertebral column">vertebral column</a>, i.e. spineless creatures). As the first four items on the list are meat from four different animals of the type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> (with vertebral column) and the last three items are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Plant">plants</a>, that explains why these are all OK to eat. But the middle three items are three different animals of the type invertebrates, which Randall does not eat.
</p><p>Randall's reason for avoiding invertebrates is somewhat outlandish: he fears that the spirits from creatures he has eaten will come back to haunt him. In horror movies, as well as in video games and roleplaying games with fantastic elements, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undead" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Undead">undead</a> creatures often appear as spooky skeletons (i.e. the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://zelda.gamepedia.com/Stalfos">Stalfos</a> of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Zelda" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a></i>); however invertebrates have no skeleton so Randall can't figure out what kind of spooky undead creature will come after him if he eats them (invertebrates may have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc_shell" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mollusc shell">shell</a> or another type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, but these do not look at all like the typical mental image of a skeleton). Randall imagines that he'll be able to fight a typical skeleton, but is afraid of the unknown ghostly creature an invertebrate may become after dying.
</p><p>The comic may also be a joke on the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Paleolithic diet">paleo diet</a> trend, which emphasizes eating fruit, vegetables, and meat ("anything with a face"). 
</p><p>Randall has previously depicted cuttlefish as spooky in <a href="/wiki/index.php/520:_Cuttlefish" title="520: Cuttlefish">520: Cuttlefish</a>, and he's also mentioned his dislike of certain foods (namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lobster">lobster</a> - another invertebrate) in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1268:_Alternate_Universe" title="1268: Alternate Universe">1268: Alternate Universe</a>.

<p>Here is a list with explanation for each item on Randalls food list:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_meat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Red meat">Red meat</a>, includes meat from most adult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mammals">mammals</a>, but many people will probably think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefsteak" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Beefsteak">beefsteak</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cattle">cattle</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pork">Pork</a>, is meat from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Domestic pig">pigs</a>. While technically a "red meat" (according to the US Department of Agriculture) it is popularly considered "the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_meat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:White meat">white meat</a>", hence its own bullet point. </li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Poultry">Poultry</a> are domesticated birds; most people will think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(food)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chicken (food)">chicken</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fish">Fish</a> covers a very large group of animals, most of them are not eaten on a regular basis, but a large group of fish are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_as_food" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fish as food">used as food</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shrimp">Shrimp</a> is used to refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapoda" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Decapoda">ten-footed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Crustacean">crustacean</a> and some of these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_(food)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shrimp (food)">used for food</a>. In the UK they often go under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawns" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prawns">prawns</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oysters" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Oysters">Oysters</a> refers to a family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mollusca">mollusca</a> within the class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bivalvia">bivalvia</a> (i.e. body enclosed in shells consisting of two hinged parts). Most people will probably think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostreidae" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ostreidae">true oysters</a> specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrea_edulis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ostrea edulis">edible oyster</a>, which are not the only edible oyster!. Note that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_oyster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pearl oyster">pearl oyster</a> is not a true oyster.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Squid">Squid</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopods" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cephalopods">cephalopods</a> (also of the mollusca family ) with eight arms arranged in pairs and two longer tentacles. They are closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopuses" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Octopuses">octopuses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fruit">Fruit</a> is a part of a flowering plant. Common fruits are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apples">apples</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranges" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Oranges">oranges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bananas">bananas</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pear">pears</a>. But in principle anything that comes from a flower is a fruit, including grains. Although in a culinary sense there is a distinction between vegetables and fruit, any part of a flower is actually a vegetable. See below and also see <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">388: Fuck Grapefruit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetables" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vegetables">Vegetables</a> are any kind of plant. But in everyday it refers to any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Umami">savoury</a> meal, thus excluding fruit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nut (fruit)">nuts</a> and cereal grains. For instance a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tomato">tomato</a> would be seen as a vegetable due to its taste and as a fruit botanically – see the Venn diagram <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Botanic_fruit_and_culinary_fruit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fruit">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Grain">Grains</a> are small, hard, dry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seeds">seeds</a>. Usually when mentioning these people will think of breakfast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cereal">cereal</a> grains. Typical grains are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Corn">corn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rice">rice</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wheat">wheat</a>. As mentioned above grains are botanically both a fruit and a vegetable.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Randall does not care if anything he eats have a face. He just wish to know if it does or not before he eats it. The plants that he eats do not have faces for sure, but he eats those. The reason he does not eat Squids or Oysters has nothing to do with faces. It is the invertebrate = missing skeleton - that is the reason as explained in the title text. The caption below the comic is an extra rule that has nothing to do with the things mentioned above, which he does not have to google!

<dl><dd>No way!

<dl><dd>How can you say what somebody else must obviously know without using google? From reading the comic, it seems like Randal is unsure whether or not an oyster has a face. From previous comics with a similar format, the printed caption is directly related to the comic, then the title text is an alternate caption that could also work with the comic.

<p><br />
Oysters arguably have a 'mouth' (maw/jaw/etc), with plenty of opportunity for pareidolia or at least marginal (head-only) anthropomorphising, depending on shell markings/adornments or perhaps the psychological willingness of the observer to read the rest of the face in the fleshy creature <i>within</i> the 'mouth'.

<dl><dd>I would disagree that a mouth would constitute a face. When looking at Wikipedia's page for face, it is only about humans, although it does mention that other animals could have faces. Guess it could be discussed if any animal that cannot make facial expressions (like humans and monkey) have a face at all. But yes I have seen by using Google that people do ask if squid and oysters have faces. But maybe that is just like Randall an attempt to make a joke on the vegetarians with this catch fraise of not eating anything with a face. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:58, 8 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>The current explanation is very rambly.   Also, it shouldn't presume what Randall knows or doesn't about shrimp, oysters, and squid and therefore shouldn't presume about what he needs to google.    <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.129.119" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.129.119">199.27.129.119</a> 14:49, 7 October 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I do think he knows how they look. He is quite knowledgeable. Of course he may not know if other people think they have a face, and thus he could Google that. But the same could be said for a fish (and there are very many different types of fish with strange "faces" or no face). And I could easily argue that a cow cannot make any facial expressions and thus it does not have a face. And then Randall cold be confused and thus stop eating beef steak... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:58, 8 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I don't think this has anything to do with whether an item actually has a face or not. I think that is a red herring brought on by the fact that the comic caption sounds very <i>similar</i> to the rule about not eating anything with a face. Randall's list of approved food items clearly are in the "face" and "no face" category alike. Thus we can conclude that Randall is ok with eating things that have a face, eating things without a face, eating things considered non-Kosher, eating carnivorous, eating vegetables, eating fruits, etc... In fact, we derive from this list that Randall has a very large array of food that is considered ok to eat. Thus his caption makes sense only when paired with the title text. Essentially, Randall doesn't eat food that creeps him out. Notice the caption states, "if I have to Google to figure out" which leads me to believe he considers that food to be other-worldly or creepy. This coincides with the title text about being creeped out by the specter of such a being.--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:R0hrshach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:R0hrshach (page does not exist)">R0hrshach</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:R0hrshach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:R0hrshach (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:34, 7 October 2015 (UTC)

<p>I think the currently explanation misses the point entirely. Two common 'food rules' are "Don't eat anything with a face" and "Don't eat anything you have to Google" (which would rule out, for example, pork and azodicarbonamide, respectively). The comic is funny because it mixes the two, which is ridiculous. The title-text is funny because it does this again with two more food rules ("Don't eat anything you would have to fight" and "Don't eat anything with a skeleton"). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jtg007&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jtg007 (page does not exist)">Jtg007</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jtg007&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jtg007 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:20, 7 October 2015 (UTC)

<p>This current explanation is really incoherent and rambly, and it goes off on so many irrelevant tangents that just confuse it even further (Why is the stuff about kosher even up there?). The many grammar and spelling errors, as well as the Danish Google link, suggests this explanation was written by someone who's not very familiar with English. Recommend that this article be overhauled and rewritten, preferably by a native English speaker.<br />Also, the title text may be a reference to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ledootgeneration">spooky skeleton</a> Internet meme. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.176" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.176">173.245.54.176</a> 00:35, 8 October 2015 (UTC)

<p>The standard plural in English of octopus is octopuses. However, the word octopus comes from Greek and the Greek plural form octopodes is still occasionally used. The plural form octopi, formed according to rules for some Latin plurals, is incorrect because the word is Greek, not Latin. Just sayin'. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.39.207" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.39.207">162.158.39.207</a> 08:13, 8 October 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I vote YES to the overhauling and rewriting. However, (1) I'm not a native English speaker and (2) I think we should agree first on what should and what shouldn't be there, to avoid repeating the situation. Here's my checklist:
</p>
<ul><li> This has nothing to do with Kosher, that should be completely removed.</li>
<li> Oysters may require googling to check whether they have anything face-like.</li>
<li> Google links shouldn't be here, Danish or otherwise.</li>
<li> I didn't know about the "nothing requiring Google", "nothing you have to fight" and "nothing with a skeleton" rules; if these are indeed common, they really are relevant and the comic should be described simply as a mashup of these. Also, references to webpages describing these would be nice (NOT google searches).</li>
<li> While I strongly support the idea that the item list is about the caption rule and has nothing to do with the title text rule, it is clear that other people strongly support the exact opposite, so both should be given as alternative explanations.</li></ul>

Apart from that I have tried to rewrite the explanation as the above mentioned (but not like below, as I believe this should be described as Randall's list!)

<p>For those of you who want to do a rewrite, here's one more topic: Randall should not be the subject of the actions. He's the author of the comic, yet the comic should be seen as entirely fictional. So the discussion is not about whether "Randall would google this or that" but "One would google this or that" -- it's not specifically about what Randall would do but what would someone do if they followed these rules, it should be turned into a more anonymous/generic subject. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">Ralfoide</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:47, 8 October 2015 (UTC)

</p><p>I believe that a "vegetarian" diet excludes all animal products, and "vegan" refers to people who also avoid every animal derived product, such as leather on belts or shoes or purses. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.103.217" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.103.217">141.101.103.217</a> 12:18, 9 October 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Definitions seem to change across time and between people (hence the need for terms such as "ovo-vegetarian" to better explain "Yes, I do still eat eggs!") but the trend I'm most familiar with is that (plain, unqualified) "vegetarians" just do not <i>eat meat</i>, whilst "vegans" avoid all products of animals (whether derived by slaughter or obtained non-fatally) for both eating and (where avoidable) other uses like clothing.  But there's plenty of scope betwixt/beyond the two to rule in/out the likes of milk, eggs, wool, leather- according to personal sensibilities and principles.  i.e. There's those who just don't want animals to be slaughtered (to provide their own diet, at least), and others who don't even want to support the whole animal husbandry system, if they can at all help it.</dd>
<dd>It gets a bit unwieldy to say "pisco-ovo-lacto-vegtarian", but I tend to assume (before I can confirm) that someone who says they're a "<i>foo-</i>vegetarian" eats vegetables, grains, fruit and <i>foo</i>, but not meat nor whichever of fish/eggs/milk isn't already covered by the <i>foo-</i>.  It generally works out Ok.</dd>
<dd>However, there are other opinions as to the definition, so it's still good to check.  Please feel free to meet me to talk about your own proclivities.  You'll find me easy to get on with.

<p>I wonder if he would have to Google whether or not wasps or cockroaches have faces(?) - they are invertebrates and thus would be excluded by that formation of the rule... but I certainly think of them as having faces, and would not feel the need to Google whether or not they have them...(?) -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Brettpeirce&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Brettpeirce (page does not exist)">Brettpeirce</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Brettpeirce" title="User talk:Brettpeirce">talk</a>) 12:54, 15 October 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I'm 173.245.49.94, finally created an account. I've restructured everything one more time and I feel the order now is just about what it should be. I'm not sure everyone (or anyone, for that matter) will agree with my editing, but that's what "be bold" is about, right? Please, someone else reads it to check it's clear and correct and, if so, remove the incomplete tag. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jojonete&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jojonete (page does not exist)">Jojonete</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jojonete&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jojonete (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:20, 18 October 2015 (UTC)
