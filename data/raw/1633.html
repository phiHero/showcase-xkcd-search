<p>This comic is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Planet Nine">Planet Nine</a>, a possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Neptune">Neptune</a>-sized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Planet">planet</a> far beyond the farthest planet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Neptune">Neptune</a>. Astronomers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Brown" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Michael E. Brown">Mike Brown</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Batygin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Konstantin Batygin">Konstantin Batygin</a> published a paper on 2016-01-20, only two days before the release of this comic. The paper is called <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22">Evidence for a Distant Giant Planet in the Solar System</a></i> and shows indirect evidence that such a planet may exist, inferred from an otherwise unlikely correlation between the unusual orbits of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planets" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dwarf planets">dwarf planets</a>. See for instance also explanations, for the layman, of the results here: <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/feature-astronomers-say-neptune-sized-planet-lurks-unseen-solar-system">Astronomers say a Neptune-sized planet lurks beyond Pluto</a></i> and <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGfv3Oay_pY">Planet X Discovered??</a></i>
</p><p>As this paper came out on the day of the previous comic's release (<a href="/wiki/index.php/1632:_Palindrome" title="1632: Palindrome">1632: Palindrome</a>), this comic's release day was the first release day after the news came out. This explains why this comic was released in the late afternoon rather than just past midnight as is often the case with normal releases. 
Once <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> heard this news, he had to decide to do this comic instead of the scheduled comic, and then invent and draw a completely new and actually very complicated comic (resulting in <a href="#Info_on_new_version">several position errors</a>) about "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_X" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Planet X">Planet X</a>" before he could release this comic. 
</p><p>Now this planet could be called Planet IX (and is labeled <i>Planet nine?</i> on the chart), as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pluto">Pluto</a>, the previously "planet 9" has been degraded to a dwarf planet. The "X" did, however, not only refer to the roman numeral! Note that Mike Brown is the astronomer that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Killed_Pluto_and_Why_It_Had_It_Coming" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming">killed Pluto</a>, or at least reduced Pluto to a dwarf planet, something that has been a subject in <a href="/wiki/index.php/xkcd" title="xkcd">xkcd</a> before; see for instance <a href="/wiki/index.php/473:_Still_Raw" title="473: Still Raw">473: Still Raw</a>.
</p><p>This was the first of two times within a month where a new astronomical announcement (of something discovered months before the actual announcement) resulted in a related comic. The second being <a href="/wiki/index.php/1642:_Gravitational_Waves" title="1642: Gravitational Waves">1642: Gravitational Waves</a>. But in that case Randall seemed to know about it in advance, as he even changed the normal release schedule to post the comic on the day of the announcement, unlike here, where he seems to have been forced to make a new comic up on the fly.
</p><p>Stating the obvious, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%E2%80%93log_plot" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Log–log plot">log–log plot</a> shows that for an object to be an unknown planet it has to be very far away, since planets are big, to explain why we haven't seen it yet. With the log scale it is possible to go from a diameter of less than 1&#160;mm to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astronomical unit">astronomical unit</a> (AU) on the Y-axis and from a distance of just 1&#160;cm up to thousands of AU on the X-axis.
</p><p>Randall's chart is somewhat humorously parochial (if not downright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Egocentric">egocentric</a>) in that it purports to measure distance not "from Earth" or from an arbitrary observer, but specifically from himself ("from me"). There is also more detail (e.g. a differentiation between bird, bugs, and skin flora) in the zone closest to the observer, somewhat reminiscent of the classic New Yorker cover illustration <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_of_the_World_from_9th_Avenue" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:View of the World from 9th Avenue">View of the World from 9th Avenue</a></i>.
</p><p>The distance calculations are somewhat problematic (see more on this below). Close distances seem to be measured from the surface of Randall's body (skin/eyes) rather than from his center of mass. All the planets (and moon) that are marked on the chart are so far away that it will not matter if the distance is measured from Randall's surface, his center of mass, or by the way anywhere on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Earth">Earth</a>. Also, the planets' diameters are so much smaller than the distance from Earth that their real size would hardly take up any space in the chart due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Logarithmic scale">log-scale</a>. The dots marking these 7 planets are thus not drawn to scale that should represent their actual size compared with the other planets. But their distance from Earth (and Randall) is not constant even on the log-scale, especially not for the nearest planets, as they can be on either side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sun">Sun</a> compared to Earth.
</p><p>The chart correctly states that if there was a planet that was at a distance from him smaller than its diameter, he would be inside it (although at the bottom of that region, it's more like the planet that would be inside him, as this line goes down to a diameter of 1&#160;cm). If the distance is to the planets center, this would also fit if he was only a radius away from the planet. As Randall is not inside the Earth but really close to it, Earth is correctly positioned on this line. However, for Earth, which is marked with the largest of the dots, he seems to have put himself a full Earth diameter away from Earth. Even using the center of mass of Earth as it's position he should only have been 6,350&#160;km away from it, but now he places the measuring point of his distance to Earth on the opposite side of the Earth so his distance to it is equal to its diameter (which would make a choosing a distance of 0&#160;km just as correct). Earth is just left of the 10,000&#160;km line on both axis, and Earth has a diameter of 12,700&#160;km, which will fit fine with the center of the dot, but not with the distance which should have been the maximum distance Randall could be from it (0 or 6350&#160;km depending on the definition of distance from Randall).
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IAU definition of planet">IAU definition of planet</a> requires a solar orbit, gravitational rounding, and "clearing the neighborhood", a controversial (at the time of its introduction) calculation of relative size that excludes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Belt_Objects" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kuiper Belt Objects">Kuiper Belt Objects</a> such as Pluto. The calculation regarding Planet Nine would make it large enough to meet the IAU definition. Using this definition the chart quickly rules out birds and bugs, although at a glance they could be mistaken for planets, something that is especially the case for planes (at night) which are even called <i>fool’s planets’</i> in the chart, a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool%27s_Gold" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fool&#39;s Gold">fool's Gold</a>. Note that anything that is actually on Earth is positioned within 60&#160;km from Randall. This is because if it is further away he cannot see them due to the curvature of the Earth. This does not mean that he intends to indicate that they cannot be further away from him than that.
</p><p>The already known planets are prominently marked on the chart. They are the solid black dots. Besides Earth and <i>Planet Nine?</i>, the bottom row of three small dots are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mars">Mars</a>. The top row of four larger dots (but smaller than the dot that marks Earth) are (from left to right) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Saturn">Saturn</a> (visible to the naked eye) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Uranus">Uranus</a> and Neptune (visible through a telescope).
</p><p>It is unclear how Randall is calculating these distances, especially to the three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planets" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Terrestrial planets">terrestrial planets</a>, since neither of these options work: closest approach, average, mean, current or maximum distance. In the comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/482:_Height" title="482: Height">482: Height</a> Randall shows (among other) the distance from the Earths surface to all the planets. For especially Venus and Mars he shows that their distance changes a lot based on theirs and Earth's orbital positions. But he has neither used these loops to base the dot size or position, as these loops clearly go closer than 1 AU and only one of the planets are drawn closer than that. It is thus unclear which of the three represents which planet, but in the <b><a href="#Table_of_items_in_the_chart">table below</a></b> it has been reasoned that the dot situated at the largest diameter of the three inner planets planets should represent Venus (12,000&#160;km) as it is almost twice as big as Mars (6,700&#160;km), which on the other hand is more similar to Mercury (5,000&#160;km) and given that the two dots furthest out are almost the same size, it would make most sense if they represent Mercury and Mars. Since the outer dot never comes closer than 2.5 AU and Mercury never gets further away than 1.5 AU it makes most sense to place Mercury as the middle of the three and Mars as the outer of the three dots.
</p><p>Below some objects are mentioned that are not on the chart, and also other errors in position (probably due the hasty creation of such a complex comic.) Many of these objects as well as the planets with the errors mentioned clearly revealed can be see in this <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/ef/Modified_possible_undiscovered_planets.png">modified image</a></b>, which is also inserted and explained <a href="#Image_used_to_create_data_for_the_table">in the trivia section</a> below.
</p><p>Pluto, no longer considered a planet (it was the ninth until 2006), is not marked on the chart, but it would be below Neptune just outside the pink region (2,300&#160;km diameter and 30-50 AU away). This makes sense since that region is for dwarf planets not yet discovered and any one as big and close as Pluto would have been discovered by now. There are thus also other dwarf planets that would not belong in the pink region, one of them is even much much closer and is easily visible with a telescope: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ceres (dwarf planet)">Ceres</a>, which would appear roughly below Mars and Jupiter. (950&#160;km diameter and 1.5-4 AU away from Earth). But this pink region is there to show where there could (and most likely will) still be undiscovered dwarf planets.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Moon">Moon</a> is also marked on the chart, with a gray dot (almost as large as the gas giants dots). The name is written in brackets since it's not a planet (because Earth is clogging up its neighborhood). Randall has messed up the positioning and the diameter of the Moon as it is clearly positioned past a million km, and it is only up to 400,000&#160;km away from the Earth.
</p><p>The Sun is not marked at all, even though it is extremely prominent, but as it is clearly not a planet it is left out. It would per definition have been at a distance of 1 AU, and with a diameter of 1.4x10<sup>6</sup> km it would be well inside the region of things that we can see during the day. Note that objects this big will always be shining, already a large planet such as Jupiter is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/jupiter-and-saturn/oclc/60393951&amp;referer=brief_results">brighter</a> than if it could reflect 100% of Sun's light. In general, <i>planets ruled out because we would see them during the day</i> refers to objects big enough to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stars">stars</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarfs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Brown dwarfs">brown dwarfs</a>, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs">the only star system</a>, other than Sun, that would fit on the chart is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>, which at 4.37 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-years" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Light-years">light-years</a> (ly) is well within the right boundary that falls at 5.68 ly, just before the distance to the next nearest star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Barnard&#39;s Star">Barnard's Star</a> at 5.96 ly from the Sun. A light year is 63,241 AU, and with the 10,000 AU mark far from the right edge of this log-log plot, it is clear that also 100,000 AU and thus a light year is within the chart. And this also goes for 5 ly.
</p><p>"Planets ruled out by the WISE survey" refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE), a space telescope designed to look for warm objects such as brown dwarfs, which generate heat at their centers. It was capable of detecting Saturn-sized or larger planets in the outer reaches of our solar system, but did not find any. WISE would not have detected "Planet Nine" (even if it exists) because it is too small and thus too cold to be detected. There is a chance that it can be seen in some more temperature sensitive measurements. But these have not been checked for such a planet yet, (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/feature-astronomers-say-neptune-sized-planet-lurks-unseen-solar-system">here</a>).
</p><p>The word <i>satellites</i> is written on the border of two regions indicating that these can be in both regions. Some are small enough (10&#160;cm) to be comparable to the <i>space junk</i> below, (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubesats" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cubesats">cubesats</a>), others are much bigger and would fit in the region above: <i>Stuff we can see through telescopes</i>. Although it may not be called a satellite in daily talk, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:International Space Station">International Space Station</a> is in fact a satellite, which is over 100 m in the longest direction. It would thus be on the border to the <i>Planets ruled out because I would have noticed them above my house</i> region just above the "A" in <i>satellites</i> (400&#160;km above the surface). Some satellites can be seen without a telescope, like the space station.

<td>Planets that would either have Randall inside or, if smaller than Randall. would be inside Randall. Earth comes close since Randall is on its surface (most of the time). The line dividing this region from the<i> Planets we see at night</i> hits the Y-axis at 1&#160;cm and then goes to the top at almost 10 AU. A dot representing Earth is on this line at around 12,700&#160;km = Earth's diameter. This is strange since this means that Randall is 12,700&#160;km from Earth. Of course this is how far he is from the far side of the Earth, but more logically it would either have been 6,350&#160;km (from Earths center) or 1&#160;cm, since his surface, that is his feet, touches Earth, except for the soles of his shoes.

The main concentration of asteroids in the belt is between Mars and Jupiter. A very slim region in this log-log chart! Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the belt. The largest asteroid is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:4 Vesta">Vesta</a> which is not gravitational rounded even with a diameter of 500&#160;km.

At that time it is much closer to the Sun than Earth at just 0.6 AU, but in 7 years time when it is the farthest away it will be out at 35 AU, further out than Neptune. But is it only of the order of 10&#160;km in diameter (11&#160;km in mean, 8&#160;km x 15&#160;km). So it can only be seen when close to the sun for a few months. This comet would fit inside this region for most of the time, when it is more than 2 AU from the sun, above the word "and" near the top of this part of the region over that word.

The reason the upper limit cut of at the same level through all this region it that if the "planets" got any bigger, then they would turn into brown dwarfs that could be seen during the day, or if they got bigger they could even turn into a small star (or big star see below), and thus would be visible by day.

<td>Dwarf planets can in principle be anywhere in the solar system. But this region is shaded pink as it only covers undiscovered dwarf planets (similar to undiscovered planets) and thus they should be at least a given distance away, before it is realistic they would not already have been discovered. Also they need to be a certain size to be able to round themselves under their own gravity. And if they are too big, it is not realistic that they are only dwarf planets. The region reaches out to the next star as the edge of the graph is almost at 6 light-years (ly)

Instead the explanation is given with a label at a small rectangle at the top left with the same color. It is in this region there could still be undiscovered planets. They have to have a certain size to be a planet if they are this far away, and also have to be this far away before it is realistic they would not already have been discovered. If they were any bigger, it would be like with the other planet regions to the left, that they would turn into a brown dwarf, (or at least Saturn sized planet) and although maybe not visible with telescopes just above this size, they would have been spotted by the WISE survey (see below).

But there are also stars swelling up to more than 10 AU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UY_Scuti" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:UY Scuti">UY Scuti</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of largest stars">the largest</a> known star, it has a diameter of almost 16 AU).

Mercury comes closest to this limit as it never gets far from the sun and thus also never strays far from being 1 AU from the Earth. The range of distances from Earth is from 0.5 to 1.5 AU, with Venus coming close to this with a range from 0.25 to 1.7 AU. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes. And for the distance this is within the limits for both Venus and Mercury's orbit. However, the diameter of Mercury is only 5,000&#160;km and this does not fit well, so from that principle it fits better with Venus. But Venus can be much longer from the Earth when on the other side of the sun, and with a diameter of 12,000&#160;km it doesn't even fit well with Venus. However, since Mars, the third planet is much closer in diameter to Mercury than Venus with 6,700&#160;km, and two of the dots are of equal and smaller size, it makes most sense that this planet is Venus.

The range of distances from Earth is from 0.25 to 1.7 AU. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes. The distance for this dot fits equally bad with both planets. The diameter is smaller than before, but it is still way too big for Mercury’s 5,000&#160;km and it is not too small but just at the limit of the 12,000&#160;km of Venus. This does thus fit better with Venus on both parameters. But Mercury is similar in size to Mars, the third dot, and the second and third dot are at the same diameter, which makes it more likely that the larger diameter for dot 2, should belong to Venus, making this dot Mercury.

<ul><li>New features in the image include more precisely marked dots of the planets and other objects.</li>
<li>The dots used for planets or objects are always larger than the diameter range, and centered on the average diameter and average distance. 
<ul><li>All the diameters used here have been taken from the relevant Wikipedia page.</li>
<li>The same orange color has been used for all planets and the Moon, except when two planets are too close on the log-log plot to be clearly distinct if the same color, then one is brown for only this reason. 
<ul><li>To avoid snide remarks Uranus is not one of those marked with brown…</li></ul></li>
<li>Dwarf planets and the like are pink</li>
<li>The comet is also in brown as it is too close to other pink dots</li>
<li>Images have been used for the suns two states and a yellow dot for the only other star.</li></ul></li>
<li>Distance:</li>
<li>Earth can have three different distances from Randall which have all been marked:
<ul><li>No distance because he is standing on top of it</li>
<li>The radius (or the center of mass), since this is the average distance Randall is from the Earth</li>
<li>Or the diameter (which is used in the comic) as the farthest distance from Randall is the opposite side of the Earth.</li>
<li>Data:
<ul><li>For the seven planets (and Pluto) the distance range and average distance from Earth has been taken from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://distancefrom.facts.co/earthtomercury/distancebetweenearthandmercury.php">this page</a> 
<ul><li>Which needs to be opened as a new page to not return to this page. </li></ul></li>
<li>For other objects the range has been taken from the relevant Wikipedia page</li></ul></li>
<li>The Moon’s distance range is small enough to be within the dot.</li>
<li>For the four outer planets the dots will as a minimum cover the range from lowest to highest distance from Earth </li>
<li>For the three terrestrial planets the distance varies so much that a bar has been added through the dot placed at the average distance, to indicate the range of distances. </li></ul></li>
<li>The original dot for planet nine covers the range of diameters (at the top just, and then further down at the bottom.)
<ul><li>The distance is centered on 1000 AU and it is expected to be between 700 and 1200 AU away, which is covered by the dot.</li>
<li>But it could be as close as 200 AU. But if it where we should have detected it by now.</li></ul></li>
<li>There are several planets/objects that are very far from the mark.
<ul><li>The moon is far off on both parameters.</li>
<li>All three terrestrial planets are way off.
<ul><li>Except of course if the 2nd planet is Venus, then the deviation for that one would not be too bad.</li>
<li>But it would not make sense to make Mercury bigger than Venus and it thus just seems that all three are far off the mark</li></ul></li>
<li>Jupiter is spot on, Saturn not far away and Uranus close enough. 
<ul><li>But Neptune is so close to Uranus on both parameters on the log-log plot, that this probably explains why it has been placed quite of the mark distance wise.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Extra additions:
<ul><li>Pluto has been included and it is not within the pink Dwarf planet region. 
<ul><li>This makes sense as it has been discovered, and any object this large and that close would have been discovered by now. </li>
<li>Thus again indicating that this region is the region of Possible Undiscovered <b>Dwarf</b> Planets.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ceres and Vesta have been included and they are not within the asteroids region
<ul><li>As they can be seen in telescopes and are the two largest objects in the belt this makes sense.</li>
<li>Their distance range is indicated with bars and ranges this wide since their distance from Earth depend drastically on which side of the sun they are.</li></ul></li>
<li>Halley's Comet has been added and here a large bar is needed to indicate the distance. 
<ul><li>The distance from the sun has been used, as it can get very close to the Earth when passing it on the way in.</li></ul></li>
<li>The International Space Station has been included
<ul><li>The distance range is given as the height above Earths surface which the line just covers (i.e. not distance from Randall when it is on the other side of the Earth.)</li>
<li>The diameter is ranging from the height of 20 m to the width of 108 m (length 73 m).</li></ul></li>
<li>The Sun has been inserted
<ul><li>Also when it becomes a red giant</li>
<li>This is a case where an actual real object would put Randall inside them. As can be seen the Sun as a red giant would be in the <i>Planets ruled out because I would be inside them</i>, as it in the end will reach a diameter of about 2 AU, it will thus reach out to Earth (as the radius is 1AU).</li>
<li>Again the way this zone is depicted using diameter rather than radius makes no sense, since the 2 AU diameter sun would only just reach out to Earth, and not out to Mars. It would make more sense to locate the red star on the boarder of this zone, which would have been the case if Randall had used radius rather than diameter.</li></ul></li>
<li>The nearest star, Alpha Centauri A, has also been included.
<ul><li>Thus only the largest of the three stars in that star system is shown. </li></ul></li>
<li>The other two stars are smaller than the sun, and the same distance away when compared to the total distance.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Why is Earth's "Distance from me" 10000km? -- <i>19:26, 22 January 2016 (UTC)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The diameter of Earth is ~12000km and distances are measured from the center of the object (that why there is a "Planet ruled out because I would be inside them" zone). I suppose Earth should be placed at a distance of 6000km instead of 12000k (as it is the radius, not the diameter that matter here). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.66.11" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.66.11">141.101.66.11</a> 19:43, 22 January 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Earth's distance seems to be to the left of the 10Mm marker on the distance line, to me, although it's hard to tell without a straightedge.  Remember the plot is diameter to distance. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.71" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.71">108.162.238.71</a> 19:52, 22 January 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, but distance from Randall, and since he is typically standing on the ground, he is either 0 m from Earth (i.e. touching it), or 6000 km from the center. To be 12,000 km from Earth he would have to be either 6000 or 12000 km up in the air. Or else it is measured to the farthest point on Earth from Randall. That would be a strange situation though. I believe he just made this too quickly and did not think about it. If he had chosen radius rather than diameter then it would have been 6000 on both scales if using the center of the Earth. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 15:27, 26 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>This comic bothers me because the diagonal line with Earth on it cannot possibly represent what it claims.  Zero cannot be plotted on the X-axis with this log scale.

<dl><dd> Only stars that are close enough to see during the day.  Actually, there's one star that <i>is</i> close enough that we can see it during the day, although for some reason Randall did not mark it on the chart: our Sun.

<dd>And I agree that it's strange that Randall didn't mark the Sun. Furthermore, the Sun fits the Greek definition of planet.

<dl><dd> No not stars, this is just about planets -- you can see the moon in the day when in the right position compared to the sun.   You would be able to see any planet during the day if the circular surface was sufficiently big, and with a planetary body that is a function of the size over the distance squared -- the moon is just so close that it does not have to that big <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.109" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.109">162.158.255.109</a> 22:25, 22 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think during the day means stars. You get much bigger on the diameter axis then Jupiter, and it starts undergoing fusion, which we could see "during the day" even at far distances because they would be providing light themselves.

<dl><dd>I agree that it means stars. Any body bigger than 1AU (or even a lot smaller) must be a star.

<p>I think Randall means "TENTH planet". 22:58, 22 January 2016 (UTC)

<p>The subtitling of planes as "Fool's Planets" is clearly intended to be analogous to "Fool's Gold", the mineral that looks a lot like gold to the (non-expert) eye.  That is, if there's a bright spot of light in the sky (usually just before dusk or just after dawn) then it might be mistaken for a planet like Venus, but instead just be the glimmer of near-horizontal sunlight off of a wing-front or body-edge of plane too high to discern a shape/silhouette against the sky, too far away to see coloured navigation lights and just happens not to be leaving a contrail.  At a glance, you might assume it was something astronomical.  Only by keeping an eye on it could you be sure to discern relatively rapid (perhaps non-ecliptic) movement and other details that would at least suggest it was no higher than a satellite.  (Of course, it would be techncally be a UFO, leastways until you actually identified it sufficiently.) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89">162.158.152.89</a> 00:24, 23 January 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Also, note the implication that Randall would keep Giant Bugs at least 100m away from him, at all times.  Doubtless by running away. (Or else by closing the doors and windows of his 100m-radius house and hiding himself away under blankets in its centre???) 00:29, 23 January 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I think the three lower planet dots are from left to right, Venus, Mars, Mercury based on their diameters which (unlike their distances from Randall) are invariant. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Co149&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Co149 (page does not exist)">Co149</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Co149&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Co149 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:22, 23 January 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd> I agree that based on the Y-axis position, the order is Venus, Mars, Mercury.

</p><p>How would the lack of birds more than 1000km away imply a flat earth? A flat earth would still have places with birds further than that from Randal.

<p>If distance is measured between center of mass of planet and Randall, then "Skin flora" is within a millimeter from Randall's center of mass.

</p><p>Not a fan of the misuse of "egocentric." It reads like someone who wants to use a vocabulary word to show off, but doesn't realize the full implications. As pointed out at the Wikipedia link, "Egocentrism is the inability to differentiate between self and other. More specifically, it is the inability to untangle subjective schemas from objective reality; an inability to understand or assume any perspective other than their own." It doesn't just mean "from my own perspective." <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Trlkly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Trlkly (page does not exist)">Trlkly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Trlkly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Trlkly (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:47, 25 January 2016 (UTC)

<p>"Planet X now planet IX" is not correct. 'X' in 'Planet X' refers to 'X the unknown', not a Roman numeral.

</p><p>Space.com today has a story about a newly confirmed dwarf planet <b>2014 UZ224</b>, which by diameter and distance would be just below the <i>AR</i> in "DWARF PLANETS". --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Egress&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Egress (page does not exist)">Egress</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Egress&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Egress (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:00, 12 October 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Technically, Uranus should be just within the "Planets we can see at night" section, as it's visible using averted vision with a reasonably-dark sky, and Neptune should be right on the border with the "Planets we can see with telescopes" section, as it's (theoretically, at least) just barely visible at its brightest using averted vision by someone with very good eyesight under an extremely dark sky. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Whoop_whoop_pull_up&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Whoop whoop pull up (page does not exist)">Whoop whoop pull up</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Whoop_whoop_pull_up&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Whoop whoop pull up (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:27, 2 May 2017 (UTC)
