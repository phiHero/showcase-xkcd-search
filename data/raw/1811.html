<p>In this comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> rates colors based on tastiness of various flavors, which makes it very similar to <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">388: Fuck Grapefruit</a>.  The colors are sorted in descending order (from most tasty to least tasty) by the midpoint of their overall taste range.
</p><p>Within each color, several individual items are placed at points marked by dots along a tastiness scale, with nine ticks ranging from bad (1) to good (9). For example, within the pink color band at the very top, watermelon is only rated 6/9 &#8212; much less tasty than cotton candy, which is almost at 9/9, making it the very best tasting flavor in the chart. Interestingly, watermelon is mentioned twice, as it is also listed under green. Usually people do not eat the green part of a watermelon, so it is strange that Randall has rated both types at almost the same level of tastiness. It could be that he sees the green watermelon as green, but also sees the pink fruit inside, so it is actually the pink fruit that is rated for both colors, or the chart is a rating of candy (such as jellybean or popsicle) flavors, as it is not uncommon for both green and pink to represent watermelon in those situations.
</p><p>For pink, blue and white there are one, two and three regions, respectively labeled with "???". It is not clear what the purpose of these is. Perhaps they indicate regions in which Randall is unable to think of any examples, and is inviting the reader to speculate. For instance, are there any pink-colored foods more tasty than watermelon (6/9) but less tasty than cotton candy (8.5/9)? It could also be that he thinks there must be other interesting foods with this color, which could seem to be the case for white and blue, where there are a group of question marks above the most tasty labeled flavor blue raspberries and vanilla for white.  The latter is yet a joke, as vanilla is black, but is often used in white food such as vanilla ice, which he may have been thinking off, or just again messes with his readers.
</p><p>The question marks thus imply an arbitrary tastiness assigned to a color that is not derived from an actual data point, however. For instance, the only blue datapoint is "blue raspberry", assigned a ranking of 5.5. But the range assigned to blue as a whole is 4 to 8. The regions on either side of the blue raspberry dot are labeled with&#160;???.
</p><p>There are a few exceptions with chocolate the most obvious as Randall makes a wide range for chocolate for brown, ranging from 2.5-9.5 out of 9. And the arrows here ends in single question marks indicating that the range could be even longer. In the title text he acknowledges the fact chocolate is its own thing and that regarding its taste reasonable people may differ in opinion.  
</p><p>The region for chocolate could not go further down because below the section for chocolate for brown food, there is another range with some other brown food items that Randall really does not like, caramel and especially coffee at 1.5/9. It may seem that Randall has never grown up to drink the drinks that society often dictates that you should drink. Not drinking Coffee (or hating it when you do) can be a problem with all the coffee breaks and meetings held over coffee etc. And as Randall has shown in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1534:_Beer" title="1534: Beer">1534: Beer</a> he also doesn't like beer...
</p><p>Although it is not so clear as with chocolate pistachio is also split up with three lines indicating a range on the green from about 5 to 7 without any assigned point to their taste. And finally popcorn at 1.5/9 simply falls below the otherwise already low and slim rating range for yellow foods (2.5-3.5) with only lemon at 3/9 included. Many people love popcorn, but not especially for the corns actual taste, which is non existing if not for the adding of salt or sugar or other additives.
</p><p>The worst taste by far to Randall, though, is licorice, and black food has a very small range from almost below 1 to less than 1.5. In USA it seems few people like licorice (although as most of the other mentioned food items, it may come in a wide variety of flavors and strengths). But in for instance northern Europe (Scandinavia) many people love it. See more explanations for all the mentioned flavors in the <a href="#Table">table</a> below. It also seems that <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit#Change_of_taste" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">Randall's taste has changed</a> over the nine years since the grapefruit comic.
</p><p>In the title text, Randall asserts that his rankings of colors and flavors are indisputable (with the exception of chocolate). This together with rather obscure flavors included ("blue raspberry", "creamsicle") rather than more obvious choices, such as banana for yellow and carrot for orange could be a jab at the reception of his first food ranking comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">388: Fuck Grapefruit</a> which ranked fruits based on their tastiness and ease of consumption. Randall claims that it is the <a href="/wiki/index.php/388:_Fuck_Grapefruit#Controversy" title="388: Fuck Grapefruit">most controversial piece</a> he has ever published. So all this is maybe just a way to generate even more controversy about this comic, and based on the <a href="#Discussion">discussion</a> below he may have succeeded.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/index.php/882:_Significant" title="882: Significant">882: Significant</a> researchers were studying the effect of eating 20 differently colored types of jelly beans (and all colors here are included except white).

<dl><dd>[Below the scale to the left is a numbered list of ten colors, the name of the color written in said color (white written on a gray background). From the color goes a thin gray line out under the scale. At different points and lengths along the scale there appear black double arrows pointing to two lines. The gray line never extends beyond the black arrows to the right. On the line of these arrows there are one to four points, that have all been labeled with gray text (both above and below the arrow to which the labels belong). Five places on three arrows there are groups of three questions marks which relates to a region on the arrow rather than a point, either with three lines pointing to the arrow (once for pink and trice for white) or just standing close beneath the arrow (twice for blue). There are only three other exceptions. First there is pistachio which has no point but has three lines going from the text to the arrow for green. Second there is chocolate, which has its own double arrow where the ends does not end in lines but in questions marks. he arrow is broken by a square bracket with normal black text written on two lines within it. This arrow does thus not connect with the other "normal" arrow for brown to the left of the chocolate arrow. And third there is a point that is outside the black arrow for yellow on the gray line for popcorn. That is the only place where the gray line exceeds any black markings as it is only broken by the dot and then continues further to the arrow.]</dd></dl>

<p>Hmm. The selection seems quite diverse compared to a standard bag of jelly beans, but doesn't really cover the range of a gourmet brand. I wonder where root beer falls, or Dr Pepper. And that's not even getting into color classification when the bean has more than one color. Personally, when I used to get gourmet jelly bean brands, I would do the squeeze-and-sniff test on a particular shade of brown, because it was used for both coffee and a flavor I liked. I remember Lore Sjöberg having a similar problem with cinnamon and cherry, but if he ever arrived at my solution, I don't know. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nyperold&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nyperold (page does not exist)">Nyperold</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nyperold&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nyperold (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:44, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Interesting theory that he's talking about flavors of jelly beans, though there's really nothing to indicate he is.

<dl><dd>I don't think its necessarily jelly beans specifically. I think it's any candy that comes with multiple flavors in a pack, including jelly beans but not limited to them.

<p>If it is jelly beans it is definitely more agreeable then actual food. Because popcorn jelly beans are awful which explains why there a outlier.

<p>Wait, lemons? I like lemons. Anyone with an excess of raw lemons for eating should send me them. I would eat them consistently if it weren't for the fact that doing so makes my gums sore afterwards. I've several times distilled lemon juice into a much, much stronger "lemon syrup" with about 1/10th the volume and the consistency of maple syrup, and my general feeling is that I would eat it like candy if it were widely available, even though it has virtually no sugar in it. Lemon flavor is best flavor! <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.133.132" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.133.132">172.68.133.132</a> 07:51, 16 March 2017 (UTC)

</p><p>"???" refers to the mystery Dum Dums flavor. I'm pretty sure about this. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.130" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.130">108.162.216.130</a> 21:18, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

<p>The question marks for blue might have to do with George Carlin's lament over the lack of blue food.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:CoderLass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CoderLass (page does not exist)">CoderLass</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:CoderLass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:CoderLass (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:53, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
</p><p>So Randall talks about the flavor of colors based on the food they are associated with, but he says "blue" and doesn't mention blueberries and says "black" but doesn't mention blackberries? WHAT? Were they just not good enough? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:JayRulesXKCD" title="User:JayRulesXKCD"><b>JayRules<i>XKCD</i></b><i>  </i></a><sup><a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:JayRulesXKCD" title="User talk:JayRulesXKCD">what's up?</a></sup> 15:18, 4 April 2017 (UTC)
</p><p>I took this as being about artificial colors. That also explains the&#160;??? areas. So, it is a guide for when getting e.g. icecream, bubblegum, yoghurt, etc. to which colour to pick, regardless of their labels... am I really alone with this? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 12:26, 1 October 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>Cotton candy's original color is obviously white, how did it managed to end up as pink at all? Also, Randall have a good metaphorical taste, but a terrible literal one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.203.25" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.203.25">162.158.203.25</a> 03:08, 9 January 2021 (UTC)
