<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> embraces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Quantified self">quantified self</a>, a popular philosophy promoting monitoring yourself with devices and data in the hope of helping your well-being. He does so in a unique and absurdly humorous way, with help from a smart watch or handheld mobile device. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>'s caption indicates he is interested in the quantified self for unusual quantities.
</p><p>Typically, fitness apps and wearable devices will track the number of steps that users take and distances walked or run, along with other measurements such as heart rate, blood oxygenation level, blood pressure, and mood. This is to encourage users to be more physically active.  However, Cueball has chosen to track a modified version of this metric, in which his path is post-processed by contracting it as much as possible without it passing through anything solid. Ordinarily, people begin and end their days in bed; in this case, it can get 'caught' where Cueball has passed through topological tunnels. (See <a href="/wiki/index.php/2658:_Coffee_Cup_Holes" title="2658: Coffee Cup Holes">2658: Coffee Cup Holes</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/2625:_Field_Topology" title="2625: Field Topology">2625: Field Topology</a> for details.) In the comic strip, we see that, over the course of his week, Cueball has looped through his house thrice and crossed under two highway overpasses, a highway sign, and apparently the St. Louis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gateway Arch">Gateway Arch</a> before almost returning home.
</p><p>This comic appeared two days after <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-ways-to-make-more-sustainable-choices/">Google's announcement that Maps Directions will be sortable by sustainability,</a> along with their support of self-quantification for sustainability when shopping for automobiles, used goods, and food.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://youtu.be/8qGV_O_y4DA&amp;t=39m33s">[1]</a> This is noteworthy because of tech industry discussions between employees and executives comparing sharply increased profits and productivity from work-from-home to the value of coastal region commercial office space holdings and leases, relative to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance">scope 3 emissions</a>.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-04-28/google-is-saving-1-billion-per-year-as-a-result-of-employees-working-from-home">[2]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-cutting-office-space-predict-long-term-savings-11625493601">[3]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/google-googl-wants-employees-to-return-to-office-despite-productivity-gains">[4]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/pay-cut-google-employees-who-work-home-could-lose-money-2021-08-10/">[5]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/01/14/google-spends-billions-on-buying-office-buildings-is-this-a-sign-of-the-post-pandemic-pushback-against-remote-work/">[6]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3659891/google-others-adding-office-space-in-anticipation-of-the-great-return.html">[7]</a>
</p><p>An "imaginary thread" connecting a person to where they came from (as portrayed in this comic, distinct from a mystical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_cord" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Silver cord">silver cord</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Red thread of fate">red thread of fate</a>) has been attested to by people experiencing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD.)<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ve309/invisible_thread_attached_to_my_back_am_i_the/">[8]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/xs50yr/xkcd_2679_quantified_self/iqjcmbv/?context=3">[9]</a> See also <a href="/wiki/index.php/100:_Family_Circus" title="100: Family Circus">100: Family Circus</a> and below for further elaboration.
</p><p>The title text mentions several things that would make the red path longer: passing one way through a tube such as a water slide; a tunnel, such as a subway or car wash; riding on a ferris wheel, or entering a building through one door and exiting another. In all cases the imaginary string would be "captured" and make the total distance longer.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="OCD_interpretation">OCD interpretation</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=2679:_Quantified_Self&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: OCD interpretation">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The quantity Cueball measures can be recognized as a specific type of OCD where people feel like they have an imaginary string connecting them to where they come from.<sup>&#91;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citation needed"><i>actual citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> This is similar to describing 4-D paths in <a href="/wiki/index.php/Minkowski_Space" class="mw-redirect" title="Minkowski Space">Minkowski space</a> relative to the observer's frame of reference.
</p><p>As they move around, that string gets entangled and they feel the urge to untangle it.  When they enter a car, they feel the need to exit the car from the same door, to avoid that the string gets trapped by forever passing through the car.  When they enter a building, they feel they need to exit using the same staircases and doorway(s), to avoid entangling the string in the building. Some situations, like turning around a lamp post, are OK because you can imagine removing the loop over the top of the lamp post, such that it is not really entangled.
</p><p>Cueball tries a new approach to deal with this OCD by integrating it in his quantified self.  He defines precisely how to measure the length of the imaginary string, reduced to its minimum, and chooses this as a quantity to monitor. Unlike most people with this OCD, who feel the urge to minimize the length, Cueball takes the opposite stance trying to maximize the (optimally minimal) length of the string. By defining as a target to achieve a given length every day, he creates a drive to embrace situations that entangle the string.  This drive opposes the natural compulsion to avoid them and hopefully cancels it.  The joke of the title text is that Cueball now becomes overly interested in all the things that are disturbing for people with the OCD.

<dl><dd>I was going to guess sorting Google Maps Directions by sustainability announced this past Wednesday. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-ways-to-make-more-sustainable-choices/">https://blog.google/products/search/new-ways-to-make-more-sustainable-choices/</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.134.17" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.134.17">172.69.134.17</a> 18:53, 30 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>How is this comic about optimizing for sustainability?
<dl><dd>It is about optimizing a particular attribute of maps directions. Sustainability is the most recent such attribute announced (two days prior to the comic) by a top-3 commercial maps directions provider. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.214.183" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.214.183">172.70.214.183</a> 06:04, 1 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Google optimizes paths for distance and time for a long time already.  The announcement is about optimizing for fuel efficiency instead.  The comic clearly speaks about measuring distance but not about fuel consumption.</dd>
<dd> The comic also insists on the topological features of constructions, namely whether there is a hole.  This has nothing to do with fuel efficiency.  And how does pulling a string taut measure fuel efficiency?  I don't understand.</dd>
<dd> The newspapers are full of events that happened 3 days ago.  What makes Google's announcement more relevant to the comic than other news? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Florian_F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Florian F (page does not exist)">Florian F</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Florian_F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Florian F (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:29, 1 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Are you saying your OCD interpretation is more likely? Do you have any sources compatible with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RSP" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:RSP">WP:RSP</a>? How do those sources compare to an annual software release announcement by a top-10 tech company? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.166.125" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.166.125">162.158.166.125</a> 09:34, 1 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What I am saying is that the Google announcement as reliable as it is, is totally irrelevant to this comic.  It is both optimization of a path.  So what?  It doesn't shed any light on any peculiarity of the comic.  If you can explain why the red line is affected by bridges and an arch, but not by buildings or mountains, in the context of sustainability an fuel reduction, you might have a case. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Florian_F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Florian F (page does not exist)">Florian F</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Florian_F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Florian F (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:35, 1 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The connection is clear to me: there is a new way to select paths based on a metric nobody has been using before. I don't feel the same way about the link to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Math_Work" class="mw-redirect" title="Math Work">Math Work</a> which is far more of a stretch, so I uncommented the first two sentences and the references, but deleted that link. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.211.126" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.211.126">172.70.211.126</a> 05:12, 2 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What is clear is that you need to tailor your description in a very abstract way to make it look related.  The context is completely different.

Randall is not saying he has a string just that he finds it funny to make these kind of calculations for what his path of the day have been.

<p>GOOMHR!<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GOOMHR">[10]</a> - Although for me it was the opposite aim. I've had periods of time when I wouldn't even like (if I noticed, I wasn't like OCD or anything[1]!!!) to make a return journey that meant I even crossed the road at a different point and thus passed under a different telegraph wire between a different set of adjacent poles, on the presumption that if I were to 'retract my path' then it would be irrevocably looped around at least one telegraph poles. (But normal lamp-posts were Ok... the path-'string' could just pass over and around the top and continue to retract. And it could pass above/below anything movable like cars, people, etc.) My ideal would be to be topologically contracted to zero length. Nut I wasn't actually obsessed by it, just... sometimes noticed when I was forced to do something that would cause such 'problems' and might deliberately ensure that any such loop was fully reversed (in strict reverse order to any such transit adding them in) <i>if at all possible</i>. Of course, once it was spoilt by one end of the journey being held by a loop, the rest didn't matter so much. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.34.71" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.34.71">162.158.34.71</a> 18:21, 30 September 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Within the period of your concern (e.g. per daily routine), I would presume. That gantry over the road will be (partially, perhaps in stages) dissasembled for maintenance at some point, if not outright taken down, allowing an arbitrarily future-sensitive thread to not be caught up in it any more. Tachyonic thread-behaviour could happily unwrap around the time <i>before</i> the gantry (or bridges, or arch) were built, and as for the house... Before completion or after the next F5 tornado, the 4D constraints are far less (a line snagged permanently in a 4D 'passage' suggests something a bit more interesting, given a closed door doesn't 'snag' in 3D, only the use of two different doorways, with or without actual doors). But limiting it to a daily assesment bookends the whole 4D construct with a virtual lintel over (and under, in the <i>t</i>-dimension) any potential gap for thread-movement that might be considered a way to be optimising to minimal necessary set of straight-line distances... Well, unless you learn the gantry was only assembled that morning, or that it had sufficient Ship Of Theseus-style repairs during the day, or a truck hit it by the end of the day... then it still acts as a looped-snagger</dd>
<dd>The car is trivial, in comparison, as we <i>know</i> it drives away in the posited scenario (and within the duration of the scenario). Even if our mental thread-pull does not allow us to tug it under the firmly ground-planted tyres, by reducing to periods of instaniousness as the 'trapped' thread is then rolled over (and even more tightly trapped, without violating the 'through solid matter' issue) you reach a point where it is now rolled <i>off</i> of (no longer underneath the car at all) so you can consider it untrapped. Unlike any thread that was threaded in through the driver's side door but out again through the passenger-side one, which traps loops completely (except for convertables, of course, or if Black Hat subsequently does a more width-wise <a href="/wiki/index.php/562:_Parking" title="562: Parking">version of the "cut'n'shut", with or without the "shut" bit</a>.</dd>
<dd>But that's just my interpretation. Thread-line obsessions probably come in various flavours and twists (can a thread-line knot about itself? And, insofar as the car example, is it basically forced to stay 'loose' but looped under the car as it drives, at least until enough of the car's wheels lose contact with the ground due to excessive speed over a humped bridge or even speedbump?) and I can't speak for all of them, but my reasonable (FCVO 'reasonable') assessment suggests that there are get outs <i>and</i> constraints that might be more universal than not. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.91.48" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.91.48">172.70.91.48</a> 01:47, 1 October 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<p>This is about a type of OCD where some people feel like they have an imaginary string connecting them to where they come from. As they move around, that string gets entangled and they feel the urge to untangle it. When they enter a car, they feel the need to exit the car from the same door, or else the string will be trapped as forever passing through the car. When they enter a building, they feel they need to exit using the same doorway(s), to avoid entangling the string in the building.
</p><p>Some cases, like turning around a lamp post are OK because you can imagine removing the loop over the top of the lamp post, such that it is not really entangled.
</p><p>There may not be an official clinical name for this variety of OCD, but one suggested one is the "imaginary path-string".
</p><p>Randall treats this OCD like a new measure to add to one's quantified self. The quantified self normally refers to the collection of measurements about your activity, like the number of steps you walk in a day, or monitoring your weight, blood pressure or calories intake. Here, Cueball measures his OCD, i.e. how long this imaginary string has become at the end of the day, after mentally untangling the string as much as possible with valid changes, like moving it around objects, but never through solid matter.
</p><p>Unlike most people with this OCD, who feel the urge to minimize it, Randall/Cueball takes the opposite stance and actually prefers to maximize the (optimally minimal) length of that imaginary string.
</p><p>The alt text tells about all the things that become useful adjuncts to this way of thinking and measuring, such as passing (one way) through any tube, tunnel or frame made of solid material that could thus capture the imaginary string and help to keep its ultimate distance as lengthy as possible. All of these situations are dreaded by the people with the more traditional version of OCD.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I also had a preoccupation with this sort of thing, for a while as a child. My magic thread was a remnant of the umbilical cord, with one end permanently anchored in the hospital where I was born. I had little or no knowledge of the fundamental nature of matter and just thought of it as a rubber band that was too small to see or feel. Like in the comic and other comments here, it could magically stretch as much as needed and would un-stretch when possible. I did not consider changing behaviour (e.g. choosing an exit to leave a building) because I had no desire for it to be longer or shorter, and it was clearly far too late to make a significant difference. I did spend quite some time thinking of all the places the thread must have gotten caught (as in the comic) and estimating its total length. (I did not consider airports, or my estimate would have been far longer). <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Mrob27" title="User:Mrob27">Mrob27</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Mrob27" title="User talk:Mrob27">talk</a>) 06:17, 1 October 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Comics with color, red-line subset</dt></dl>
<p>As <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Comics_with_color" title="Category:Comics with color">Category:Comics with color</a> doesn't have a currently extant Talk-page to it, mentioning it here (although not sure if this one counts, as much, for my suggestion). Many CwC examples are basically "monochrome with added red" (<a href="/wiki/index.php/2639:_Periodic_Table_Changes" title="2639: Periodic Table Changes">'corrections' to periodic tables</a>, e.g.) that are distinct from "having lines of various colours" (like <a href="/wiki/index.php/657:_Movie_Narrative_Charts" title="657: Movie Narrative Charts">multidata plottings</a>), which are in turn distinctive from <a href="/wiki/index.php/2598:_Graphic_Designers" title="2598: Graphic Designers">floodfilled</a> or <a href="/wiki/index.php/1024:_Error_Code" title="1024: Error Code">brushstroked</a> multihue images. A simple(ish) algorithm could autoclassify all images with any non-greyscale pixels in them, but (from a human perspective, which is <a href="/wiki/index.php/1530:_Keyboard_Mash" title="1530: Keyboard Mash">definitely my kind of perspective</a>!) I think that we could sub-split CwC candidates into something like "(Monochrome) Comics with added red lines", and the rest. Doubtless some are going to be edge-cases (is this one technically a red-line one? Probably, but it's not really the same as a 'correction/annotation' red-lined comic), but such subcategorisation might still be broadly useful. - Just a wild idea, that you could perhaps safely ignore. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.90.117" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.90.117">172.70.90.117</a> 02:25, 1 October 2022 (UTC)

I've been staring at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/sasha85ru/sasha85ru1704/sasha85ru170400010/75016847-ferris-wheel-open-cabins-of-the-ferris-wheel-.jpg">an image like this</a> for a few minutes now and can't figure it out. I presume it has something to do with the cabin <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/J2PA3X/ferris-wheel-cabins-against-a-blue-sky-J2PA3X.jpg">dropping within the circle of the eye</a>?

<dl><dd>I think some ferris wheels have you enter on one side and exit on the other, which makes people waiting in line not ahaving to get out of your way. Not all, but I have tried at least one. And in such a wheel your string would go through the cabin (which then also goes around and around, thus maybe winding up the string?) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:05, 3 October 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Unless you restricted your ride to just the single circuit (and, even then, with infrastructure caveats about cabin/gondola entry and exit) every loop you made of a standard "axle with two supports" Ferris-style wheel would thread you (inexorably) through the legs/axle 'doorway' sat upon the ground. This can only be avoided by having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:London Eye">single-sided support</a> for the wheel.</dd>
<dd>Though, recalling my few journeys upon that particular example, <i>despite</i> that offset support, plus the ride being just a single slow loop (minus the small distance between pod-empty point and the pod-fill one for the next occupants), <i>plus</i> the gondolas/pods being external (with traditional internal gondala-to-wheel being a further 'threading' action to be concerned about), there were other thread-loop-holding aspects even to the queuing experience, if one cares to keep track of such things.</dd>
<dd>You <i>could</i> design a threading-free 'wheel', even multi-turn, but almost every example built without such considerations (all of them?) will provide at least one 'tunnel', probably more, whether wanted/desired or unwanted/undesirable for your mental or virtual thread-tracking purposes. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.98.97" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.98.97">172.71.98.97</a> 14:59, 3 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Oh, I hadn't considered the "foot" of the ferris wheel at all, that is indeed clever. It is still hard to visualize, but if you ignore that the wheel exists at all and just thread the "string" between four feet and around a central spoke, it would indeed work out like this. Thank you! You can mentally reshape the ferris wheel to be a table or a horse, it becomes a lot more obvious. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Maplestrip" title="User:Maplestrip">Maplestrip</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Maplestrip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Maplestrip (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:01, 4 October 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Not even <i>four</i> feet (although A-frame supports could give additional 'side doors' to entangle through, if you enter one side and exit the other, going through the splayed beams mak8ng up each vertical side), imagine some American-jive/Lindihop(sp?) dance move where the gal gets swung under the guy's legs. And possibly over his head and through them again in the more energetic dance-moves! Until/unless he lifts his feet, her 'life-thread-path' is wrapped around the ground-loop he forms.</dd>
<dd> And 'hungunder' baskets rotate around the pivot to the wheel's circumference which (by making your frame of reference stationary to the wheel) continually loop round and through the wheel-rim, being a wheel-axle/wheel-structure-basket-axle loop that the passengers additionally tangle round and through (once per ride rotation), like some sort of demented knitting-machine* crossed with a crazy bread-mixer.
<dl><dd>* – not quite right, knitting machines don't loop-through the same as a sewing-machine's second thread does, or dodge in and out and round like a loom's shuttle around the warps, but there's probably some single-thread fabrication technique that truly knots like a ferris-wheel might do if you were to feed it an appropriate cord.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>For no-hoop ferris-wheels, something like can be seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kids+small+mini-wheel+ride+coin+operated">here</a> would work. (Though with the multi-car designs the question is whether you count/mind/endure your invisible-thread possibly being braided up with other riders' invisible-threads, like a rope-making machine does.) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.49" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.49">172.70.85.49</a> 14:46, 4 October 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Cueball makes 2.5 loops of the house, not 2 as in the explanation - 3 passes of the interior, and 2 of the exterior.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.91.48" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.91.48">172.70.91.48</a> 08:19, 4 October 2022 (UTC)

Bridge and sign are nothing!
The thing you really get entangled with are all the electrical wires
from telephone poles to the opposite side of the road.
