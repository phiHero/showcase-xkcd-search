<p>This is a list of probabilities for different events. There are numerous recurring themes, of which the most common are free throws (13 entries), birthdays (12), dice (12, split about evenly between 6-sided (d6) and 20-sided (d20) types), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%26M%27s" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:M&amp;M&#39;s">M&amp;M</a> candies (11), playing cards (9), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:NBA">NBA</a> basketball mid-game victory predictions (9), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Scrabble">Scrabble</a> tiles (7), coins (7), white Christmases (7), and the NBA players <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stephen Curry">Stephen Curry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:LeBron James">LeBron James</a> (7 each). 
</p><p>Themes are variously repeated and combined, for humorous effect. For instance, there are entries for both the probability that St. Louis will have a white Christmas (21%) and that it will not (79%). Also given is the 40% probability that a random Scrabble tile will contain a letter from the name "Steph Curry". 
</p><p>There are 80 items in the list, the last two of which devolve into absurdity - perhaps from the stress of preparing the other 78 entries.
</p><p>The list may be an attempt to better understand probabilistic election forecasts for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2020 United States presidential election">2020 United States presidential election</a>, which was four days away at the time this comic was published and had also been alluded to in <a href="/wiki/index.php/2370:_Prediction" title="2370: Prediction">2370: Prediction</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/2371:_Election_Screen_Time" title="2371: Election Screen Time">2371: Election Screen Time</a>. Statistician and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephologist" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Psephologist">psephologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nate Silver">Nate Silver</a> is referenced in one of the list items. On the date this cartoon was published, Nate Silver's website FiveThirtyEight.com was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">publishing forecast probabilities</a> of Donald Trump and Joe Biden winning the US Presidential election. On 31 October 2020, the forecast described the chances of Donald Trump winning as "roughly the same as the chance that it’s raining in downtown Los Angeles. It does rain there. (Downtown L.A. has about 36 rainy days per year, or about a 1-in-10 shot of a rainy day.)" A day previously, when the chances were 12%, the website had also described Trump's chances of winning as "slightly less than a six sided die rolling a 1".
</p><p>The probabilities are calculated from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/2379/sources/">these sources</a>, as mentioned in the bottom left corner.
</p><p>The title text refers to the song "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_Maybe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Call Me Maybe">Call Me Maybe</a>" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carly_Rae_Jepsen" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Carly Rae Jepsen">Carly Rae Jepsen</a> (cited twice in the list). "MAYBE" is emphasized, perhaps because the probability of getting her phone number correct, as in the last item in the list, is very low. The capitalization could also be a reference to Scrabble tiles, as was previously mentioned in association with Carly Rae Jepsen.

<p>There's a discrepancy between the version here and the current official version. Here, 0.2% has the red M&amp;Ms thing paired with the odds of drawing a flush in poker ("you draw 5 cards and they're all the same suit"); the official version has it with "You draw 2 random Scrabble tiles and get M and M." Here, the latter piece of information is at 0.1%, and there the 0.1% item is "Three randomly chosen people are all left-handed."

</p><p>I have to think the second to last is off. First, what is meant by "just been"? Minutes, hours, days? Second, does anyone know the correct number of 10-digit phone numbers that are answered by people named "Barack Obama" (as pronounced, not spelled)? I remember that Obama had a cell, and including the phones in his office and his bedroom (separate #'s), so during his term, that's at least 3. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:SDSpivey" title="User:SDSpivey">SDSpivey</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:SDSpivey" title="User talk:SDSpivey">talk</a>) 15:50, 31 October 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>first of all, this is no longer his term, so the number of phone numbers he has nowadays might be different.  Also, the scenario requires him to pick up the phone, and he probably wouldn't simultaneously be available to pick up a phone in both his office and bedroom, and unless it's a cell phone, only a fraction of the time would he be there.  Also, like many people, he might not answer calls from unknown numbers, or he may have a secretary or someone screening his calls.  Judging from the following line though, the calculations used here probably just used 1 in 10 billion for that value, leaving only the "just been an 8.0 earthquake in Calfornia" part.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.124" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.124">108.162.216.124</a> 09:12, 1 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Isn't the second to last entry really just a sneaky way of listing the probability of a magnitude 8 earthquake having just occurred in California?  The entry says nothing about Barack Obama actually answering the phone, nor even that the number dialed being Barack Obama's.  If agreed, then can the explanation in the table be updated?  If disagreeing, then I'd appreciate you pointing out where I'm in error.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>There are currently 6 colors, blue, red, brown, yellow, green and orange. Each comes in different ratios, for some reason. If there were all the same ratio, then getting 2 that are both red would be 1/36=2.777%, so red is below average. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:SDSpivey" title="User:SDSpivey">SDSpivey</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:SDSpivey" title="User talk:SDSpivey">talk</a>) 00:58, 1 November 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The colors used to be different a number of years ago.  I forget what year, but they had a contest for people to vote on a new M&amp;M flavor.  They had people vote between blue, pink, and purple.  I guess blue won as both pink and purple are considered girly colors and blue is considered manly, but the presencee of two girly colors split the vote for that.  At the same time they got rid of there having used to be light brown M&amp;Ms, and for a while they had commercials with blue M&amp;Ms singing the blues.  Anyway, I also read speculation the reason some colors are more common is they put less of the ones where the dye they use is more expensive, though I'm not sure if that's accurate.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.124" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.124">108.162.216.124</a> 09:07, 1 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I don't understand the "You share a birthday with two US Senators" as being 4%.

<dl><dd>I'm not certain of the math offhand, but it is the odds of randomly sharing a birthday with 2 out of 100 Senators. Not that just a pair shares one with you.

<dl><dd>It's been updated to say that there are 15 days that have at least 2 Senators who share a birthday. That would make the probability (15/365.25), or 4.1%, so Randall is correct.

<p>I think I've got how Randall did the birthday party/free-throw calculations, but it's kind of math-intensive. How much should I put in the explanation column? It's quite easier to explain with summations, but that requires a lot of background to someone who doesn't know calculus (i.e., probably a lot of people who read this). Should I forego the sum entirely? Should I say "the proof is by magic"? Also, at least some of this is stemming from the fact that I have no clue how one would insert a summation sigma into the editing, and I'm too afraid to try it. I'll write it with a bunch of plus signs (basically a sum, but longhand notation) until somebody decides to step in and clean it up. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:BlackHat" title="User:BlackHat">BlackHat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:BlackHat" title="User talk:BlackHat">talk</a>) 18:05, 1 November 2020 (UTC)

<p>I'm beginning to think Randall is nerd-sniping us, because none of the values for M&amp;M colours seem to line up with his source. The easiest example to demonstrate is '77%&#160;: An M&amp;M is not blue'. <i>Nowhere in the article is there a value which rounds to 23% for blue M&amp;Ms.</i> Most of the other calculations also seem to have small-scale differences, and a few have differences so big only using the 95% confidence interval values help. Can anybody figure out his line of reasoning with this? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:BlackHat" title="User:BlackHat">BlackHat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:BlackHat" title="User talk:BlackHat">talk</a>) 19:12, 1 November 2020 (UTC)

In the southern hemisphere, where summer is December-February and winter is June-August, the figures should be reversed (and at the equator, summer and winter don't really exist). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.86.114" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.86.114">172.68.86.114</a> 21:49, 1 November 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I'm not entirely sure <i>which</i> season boundaries are being espoused.  Equinox/Solstice ones (summer starts on "mid-summer's day", <i>sic</i>), mid-way between adjacent equinoces/solstices (mid-summer's day <i>is</i> exactly half way through summer), meteorlogical (groupings of three calendar months)..? I suspect the latter, to provide the off-quarter values from almost continually variable month-lengths, but the other two (in conjunction with the elliptical orbit of the Earth changing the rate each phase of oscillation made by the ecliptic) would be a far more scientific reason worthy of Randall. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.155.102" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.155.102">162.158.155.102</a> 02:47, 2 November 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>This covers two entire years (leap and non-leap). It assigns (northern) winter to whatever year it most lies within, for percentile purposes, as indicated by shared background. The 'astride' seasons start at the calculated mid-point between astronomical 'quarter-points', which is probably not how it's based IRL, and I give the mid-point difference from the quarter-point that <i>should</i> be their mid-point. Times are UTC, bare dates can be assumed midnight to midnight. Any leap-seconds I may have ignored are well below my level of precision. Also note E&amp;OE, with plenty of possible transfer errors in plugging the raw details into the spreadsheet then re-transfering the spreadsheet into a wikitable format (across various screens/machines, because I'm an idiot). Also does not take into account actual demographic distribution across the solar year, which probably is what <i>really</i> is at work here. But I too thought it'd be interesting to look at it this way.

<p>I'm was thinking about the second-to-last probability. This should be Pr[call Obama] * Pr[Magnitude 8 earthquake "just" occured in CA] = 5e-18.
</p>
<ul><li> From the phrasing we assume 10-digit numbers are dialed randomly, giving Pr[call Obama] = 1e-10</li>
<li> From the previous quake we know Pr[CA quake/year] = 2e-3</li>
<li> The time period for "just occurred" is not defined.</li>
<li> SDSpivey points out there is some ambiguity with the number of phones Obama has and whether to include the probability of him answering personally</li></ul>
<p>If we assume Obama answers a single phone number than the time period would be 5e-18/(1e-10 * 2e-3) = 2.5e-5 years = 13 minutes.
</p><p>It seems likely that a 15 min period was considered for "just occurred", which would be within rounding error of the quake probability.

<p>Hi! Would it be possible to add an explanation as to what a free throw is, for the benefit of those of us who know nothing about basketball? Thanks! <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.158.183" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.158.183">162.158.158.183</a> 13:03, 2 November 2020 (UTC)
Sure: when one of a number of transgressions of the rules occurs (a "foul"), depending on about 17 other variables, the player who was fouled is allowed to stand at a special line called the "Free-throw line" and take either one, two or three shots at the basket without anyone guarding him.  Free throws only count one point, as opposed to baskets made during play which are 2 points (or 3 points outside yet another circular arc some distance from the goal).
</p>
<dl><dd>Thanks. Would it be possible to include that in the main explanation text, or at least include a wikilink to an explanation?  Not everyone who reads xkcd will know what one is. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.159.46" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.159.46">162.158.159.46</a> 12:36, 9 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Fairly certain this calculation is wrong.  It assumes that births are divided evenly across the dates of the year, but some birth dates are more common than others. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.134.84" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.134.84">162.158.134.84</a> 20:59, 2 November 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Are you referring to the fact that Feb 29 is far less common than other birthdays? Or the fact that December 25th is noticeably less common (with a similar albeit smaller uptick on Dec. 26) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.panix.com/~murphy/bday.html">https://www.panix.com/~murphy/bday.html</a> (a study of ~400,000 birth dates) and my own personal investigation using a dataset of a half million college applicants show that the distribution of birthdates is very close to the expected value that statistics would predict, with the glaring exception of Dec. 25 and 26.  For the single-digit accuracy that Randal is using (rounding 2/3 to be 67% for example) the distribution of birthdays is close enough to flat for the computed value to be valid.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.87" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.87">162.158.79.87</a> 05:15, 4 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
