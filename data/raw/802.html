<p>This comic shows a map of internet communities where the size of each region roughly corresponds to its size, and its proximity to other regions indicates similarities.
</p><p>This is the successor of <a href="/wiki/index.php/256:_Online_Communities" title="256: Online Communities">256: Online Communities</a>. It differs in that it is updated, and furthermore, instead of using the <i>membership</i> of whichever service to determine its size on the map, it uses its "daily social activity."
</p><p>The map actually has two super−maps intended to show the relative usage of types of communication: the online community map is surrounded by the much larger "countries" of E−Mail, SMS ("Instant Messaging") and "Cell Phones," which in turn are surrounded by the even huger "Spoken Language."  It is unclear whether "Cell Phones" is intended to represent an independent region, or whether it is meant to be a sub-region of "Spoken Language."  The ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that cell phones are the primary medium of SMS, and are also used to access email and online communities.  It's also unclear why other forms of communication, such as handwritten letters, are not included.
</p><p>At the title text <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> explains that, using his definition of "most activity per day," Farmville is actually the <i>second</i> most popular social-network farming game - the Chinese game Happy Farm was more popular at the time. This strikes many English-speaking xkcd readers as odd, because Farmville is much more famous, leading one to wonder how it could not be the most played. The phrase "browser-based social-networking-centered farming game" is an example of an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">overly-narrow superlative.</a>

<p>The Facebook region deals with social networks, that is, websites oriented towards having people meet.
</p><p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Facebook">Facebook</a></b> is a social networking site that allows people to meet old real−life friends and make new friends that share similar interests. One of its most notable features is that a member can update a "status" or make normal posts about the happenings of the member's life, complete with pictures, other members "liking" these posts. The size of the Facebook region is not exaggerated; most websites seem to allow "liking" their content or allow/require logging in the website with a Facebook account. There even are cell phones with a "Facebook" button!
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:FarmVille">FarmVille</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Town" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Farm Town">Farm Town</a></b> are Facebook games in which users manage farms. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Farm" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Happy Farm">Happy Farm</a>,</b> the Chinese game that inspired the other two, does not require Facebook integration, so it is separated by a solid line from Facebook. The "Unethical Bay" refers to how these games tend to addict players into constantly buying virtual items of questionable value.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>People You Can't Unfriend</b> refers to people whom, due to real-life expectations and relationships, unfriending them is difficult, no matter how you really feel about them.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Blatherskite River</b> refers to the conversations on Facebook, which may be long yet devoid of general meaning or logic.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Data Mines</b> refer to the data mining that Facebook does with the interests of its members. This fuels the profitable advertising business at the expense of customer trust.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions</b> refer to how interactions with family members on Facebook suddenly become more awkward because everyone on Facebook (and sometimes <i>off</i> Facebook, given that you do not necessarily need to log in if you want to see someone's Facebook account) if you are discussing with your family through post comments.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>524,287 Strong for Mersenne Primes</b> refers to the communities who gain followers for a cause. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mersenne prime">Mersenne prime</a> is a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2; 524287 is the 7th known Mersenne prime.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Jungle-Bay Mountains of "It's Complicated"</b> refers to one of Facebook's options as to what a user's relationship status currently is. A Jungle-Bay Mountain is a complicated and undefined climate, hence the complication.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>"lamebook bay"</b> refers to the online website "lamebook", where users post photos of funny things that happen on Facebook (these can include statuses, "fails", put-downs and images.)</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>"Old Facebook" Resistance</b> refers to Facebook's earlier users, who have often resisted (and resented) changes made to Facebook as it became more popular.  </li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Privacy Controls</b> is located on the map surrounded by a Lava Pool, which is a reference to how difficult it is to find the privacy controls within Facebook.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Niche Market Mountains</b> refers to social networks aimed towards more niche markets are located. Similar to how mountains tend to be isolated from mainland, niche social networks tend to be just that: niche, without much interaction with the general populace.</li>
<li><b>Charred Wasteland of Abandoned Social Networks</b> refers to the tons of websites wanting to take advantage of the success of websites like Facebook to compete or even overpower with them. Even so, these websites tend to not have the userbase or even the expertise towards the long-term, hence they become wastelands: environments devoid of life, except the few life forms that are from these wastelands (in this case, the ones who are loyal to the website or which are sadly few). </li>
<li>In the Charred Wasteland stands <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a></b>, the titular broken statue of Shelley's poem. In the poem, only "two vast and trunkless legs of stone" and a "shattered visage" are all that remain of the once-great statue and both of these features are present in the comic. According to the poem, the pedestal before the broken statue reads "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings..." hence "friend of friends" below Ozymandias on the map.</li>
<li>In the north are the <b>Duckface Mountains</b> and the <b>Red Cup Mountains</b>."Duckface" refers to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/duck-face">this incredibly obnoxious facial expression</a>, and "red cup pictures" are any pictures containing party-goers holding disposable red plastic beverage cups. Facebook is absolutely flooded with both types of pictures.</li>
<li>In the south is <b>Buzzword Bay</b>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Buzzword">Buzzwords</a> are words and phrases that make you sound a lot more topical than you actually are, used to garner attention; again, Facebook status updates are commonly filled with buzzwords.</li></ul>
<p>While Facebook is the largest "country" of the Facebook Region, there are a lot of smaller "countries" that represent smaller social networks.
</p>
<ul><li>Below Facebook (and "Old Facebook' Resistance") is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(social_network)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Diaspora (social network)">Diaspora</a></b>, a fully open-source, decentralized, privacy-respecting-and-expecting alternative to Facebook. From what this map tells, Diaspora is little-known, even if Facebook is taken out of the context.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StudiVZ" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:StudiVZ">StudiVZ</a></b> is a German-speaking social network similar if not a ripped-off version of Facebook.</li>

And they've got 7 kids??"</a> (Incidentally, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2003325519_adcouple27.html">there is more to the coupled picture than what the advertisement says.</a>)</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Myspace">Myspace</a></b> is a social networking website that is a kind of proto-Facebook: users could customize their one-page websites with whatever they wanted, make their interests and daily lives public, and interact with other users. Back in the mid 2000s, MySpace was the largest social network, many people using the website; however, the surprisingly-less-customizable Facebook ended up taking the place of MySpace. The "bands" country of MySpace refers to how a lot of bands in the day advertised and interacted using the website. Indeed, the latest incarnation of MySpace (in terms of 2013) is more oriented towards band members.</li>

<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_Online" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gaia Online">Gaia</a></b> or Gaia Online, while not an MMO, is a forum oriented towards pop culture, including video games and Japanese media. Its most notable feature is the heavy customization possible of a member's pixel-art avatar. Its members tend to roleplay a lot, albeit in a more written, story-based form. Gaia has gained a reputation with its members stealing art and causing drama. The ferry that links the gaia island with 4chan was most likely due to the "boxxy" row, where vlogger boxxy posted videos of her using gaia, which then were circulated on 4chan. This resulted in a division of the sites users, and many more hacking attacks, including a DDOS attack on 4chan itself.</li>

<ul><li>The <b>Mountains of Steam</b>, referring to the game distribution service <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> where people can buy and download video games in general, not just MMOs. There is also an extensive <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://steamcommunity.com/">community</a> where users can share content, and instant messaging chat by text, voice, or game streaming.</li>
<li><b>River Grind</b> refers to "grinding." In most MMOs, the character is a fighter of some sorts, yet starts at a level 1, signifying the character's aptitude level in combat. The character can level up and gain more aptitude levels through earning experience, of which the most reliable and otherwise common way is the process of "grinding," that is, repeatedly fighting opposing monsters (sometimes of a level notably lower that your character's), gaining experience points from winning these battles until your character gains a level, that is, "levels up". While a practical necessity in strengthening the character, this process can be tiresome, hence the expression "grinding."</li>
<li><b>Spawn Camp</b> refers to "spawn points", the places where AI-powered enemies and players who have died in-game respawn, and the act of "spawn camping", in which the player character simply stands behind or around the spawn points to fight the enemy creatures or respawning players as soon as they appear.</li>
<li><b>Gulf of Lag</b> refers to how the MMO can be slowed down a considerable amount due to the large amount of players simultaneously using the same server, this congestion bogging down the server and frustrating the users.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/final-boss-of-the-internet">End Guy for the Internet</a></b> refers to "end bosses," the last — and usually hardest to defeat — "bad guy" in a game (or a section of a game).</li></ul>

<p>The YouTube region refers to websites that are based on user-created content.
</p><p><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></b> is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google had purchased YouTube.
</p><p>Many of the sites on the map are just references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Viral video">viral videos</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:YouTube">YouTube</a>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Viral Shores</b> refers to how viral videos (whether they be viral marketing or simply memes)  tend to proliferate on YouTube.</li>
<li><b>Britney</b> likely refers to pop singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc‎">"Leave Britney Alone" guy</a>.</li>

<li><b>Rick Rolling Hills</b> references, well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rickrolling">Rickrolling</a>. More information <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>. The "deserted" note likely refers to how Rick Astley himself is tired of the meme, or again, how people tend to leave the video upon getting "Rick Roll'd," never actually going to the video with the express purpose of viewing the video.</li>
<li><b>Lunar Landing Soundstage</b> is, of course, a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Moon landing conspiracy theories">Moon landing conspiracy theories</a>, which Randall has railed on before.</li>

<p>The <b>HTML5 swamp</b> refers to YouTube's spotty support of HTML 5 (an update on HTML that is frequently touting its media capabilities, making HTML 5 a viable alternative to Flash). Of course, by the time the comic was written, HTML 5 was still in its infancy. The Music Video Bay refers to the amount of music videos (official or otherwise) are present in YouTube.
</p><p>Other counties of the YouTube region include:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://vimeo.com/">vimeo</a></b>, a website where people tend to showcase artistic content that they made on their own, notably independent studios.</li></ul>
<p>Snob Sound:

<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://fotolog.com">Fotolog</a></b>, a photo website very popular in South America in 2004-2008, which was used as a social network.</li>

<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a></b>, the largest art website, where people can upload, sell, and buy not only art itself, but also video, audio, Flash-work, and even skins (the original purpose of deviantArt). While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a></b>, a website that hosts art, (Flash-based) videos, audio, and (Flash-based) games to which other users can comment and rate.

<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></b>, where people could make a blog and post text, pictures, video, audio, quotes, and links. The most distinguishing feature is the ability to "reblog" these posts from other's people's blogs into the user's own blog. Notable features of Tumblr include sketchblogs (where people upload their sketches), Ask blogs (where people answer questions other users ask, the moderators of these blogs usually pretending to be a character from a form of media), and the large amount of "social justice" (a highly controversial political movement). (See also <a href="/wiki/index.php/1043:_Ablogalypse" title="1043: Ablogalypse">1043: Ablogalypse</a>.)</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B3ta" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:B3ta">b3ta</a></b> is a popular British website, described as a "puerile digital arts community" by The Guardian.</li></ul>
<p><br />
The <b>Isle of teenagers who just discovered macroeconomics</b> is a joke about how teenagers tend to think that the world and the economy are a lot simpler than they actually are. Combined with the typical internet mindset, this leads to a lot of teenagers posting blogs and videos and comments on blogs and videos describing how idiotic the government and other red-tape-related adults are.
The <b>Snob Sound</b> could refer to the large amount of people who look down on others in the surrounding websites (one example being an original artist looking down on people who draw mainly fan-art).  <b>The Iraq</b> is a reference to Miss Teen USA 2007, in which Ms. Teen South Carolina, Lauren Katlin, said "I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as...the US should help the US and should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we are able to build up our future." The usage of "the Iraq" has became a meme.

<p>The Skype Region refers to different IM, or Instant Messaging services, that enable almost-real-time text chatting between multiple people.  These often allow services like voice chat and even video calls.

<li><b>Fandom Blogs</b> are blogs created by a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fandom">fandom</a>" which is a community of fans. A fandom blog deals with the subject matter of the respective fandom.</li>

<p>Forums are websites where one person post a topic to which other people can discuss.
</p><p>While the map has a zoomed in version, this article shall discuss the two bigger islands, first.
</p>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.2ch.net">2channel</a></b> is a Japanese imageboard that was actually the original inspiration for 4chan.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a></b> is a classified advertisement website with sections devoted to just about everything... which formerly included prostitution services, hence the <b>The Former Site of Adult Services</b>.</li></ul>
<p>In the zoomed-in map, there is the following:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.4chan.org/">4chan.org</a></b> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Imageboard">imageboard</a> in which people can upload pictures while others comment on them. The website is infamous for its loose/often non-existent rules, incredibly vulgar userbase, source of new memes, and spawning of trolls. 4chan's random board, known internally as <b>/b/</b>, is almost constantly flooded with porn and image macros. This is why Randall's incarnation of 4chan is roughly shaped like a penis.</li>
<li><b>420chan</b> and <b>7chan</b>, other imageboards in the style of 4chan. Their relative lack of popularity and derivative nature leads a lot of 4chan users to mock them; hence, their position on Randall's map suggests that they're mere wads of semen.</li>
<li><b>Encyclopedia Dramatica</b>, labeled <b>ED</b> on the map, is a wiki site dedicated to chronicling internet memes and other noteworthy sites, events, people, and anything else that catches their attention, generally in a very satirical manner. The site is heavily populated by 4chan users. Many people are offended by the articles and talks that go on in the wiki and forum, which is perhaps the reason that it appears to be represented as a wad of sperm. The image of sperm also makes sense since ED is used as a messaging center for the group "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a>" which is represented in the map as part of the testicles of the 4chan island(see below at the gulf named Anonymous).</li>
<li><b>Tunnel to Habbo</b> is a reference to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pools-closed">the 2006 Habbo Hotel Raids</a>, in which hundreds of 4chan Anons simultaneously logged onto Habbo Hotel and proceeded to be as obnoxious as possible, standing in formations of swastikas and penises or body-blocking the swimming pools.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catbus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Catbus">Catbus</a> Route</b> is likely a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lolcat">Lolcats</a> in general.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/">eBaum's World</a></b> is a media-hosting website founded by Eric Bauman. The site has lost a lot of traffic after (quite valid) accusations of stolen content.</li>
<li>The gulf labelled <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Anonymous (group)">Anonymous</a></b> is most likely a reference to the leaderless, anonymous international network called "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a>" which is composed of (mainly)  anarchic activist hackers. Anonymous  was created on the /b/ messaging board of 4chan, hence why the bay of Anonymous is on the coast of /b/. Also, the fact that the bay is in the "testicles"(/b/) of the 4chan island "penis" is referring to how Anonymous was created on 4chan, in the same way that sperm is created in the testicles of a penis, possibly a subtle jab at the group.</li></ul>
<p>To the south and east is an archipelago of islands representing various regional and special-interest forums. Moving clockwise from 4chan island is
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Storm 2K</b> is an online website hosting information on tropical cyclones and tools for tracking them, and has a forum with multiple categories and threads for discussion on tropical cyclones, as well as multiple tropical cyclone models and reconnaissance information.</li>
<li> <b>Skyscraper city</b> is an internet forum website for skyscraper hobbyists and enthusiasts.</li>
<li> An island containing two websites related to women, namely
<ul><li> <b>Wizaz.pl</b> is a Polish website, presumably for women, with a forum filled with discussions mainly about beauty, health, women, hobbies, and fun.</li>
<li> <b>Baby and bump</b> is a self-described "pregnancy forum, baby and parenting community."</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>An island contaning

<ul><li><ul><li> <b>ForoCoches</b> is a very popular Spanish (as in from Spain) forum mainly about automobiles, but holds discussions on virtually any topic.</li>
<li> <b>Bodybuilding.com</b> is(as you can hopefully tell) a website for bodybuilders. It contains a forum for general discussions on bodybuilding that includes topics such as supplements, exercises, and nutrition.</li>
<li> <b>Bokt.nl</b> calls itself the largest community on the topic of horses. A Dutch website, it holds topics about virtually anything involving horses.</li>
<li> <b>Cruise Critic</b> is a website with a large forum about cruises in general.</li></ul></li>
<li> <b>Lay it low</b> is a website for discussing lowriding(changing a car so that its ground clearance go lower than the clearance of the original design from the manufacturer.</li>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.twoplustwo.com/">Two plus two</a></b> is a poker &amp; gambling forum</li>
<li> An island containing:
<ul><li> <b>Fan forum</b></li>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.facethejury.us/">Face the jury</a></b> is an online forum, originally founded for users to upload pictures of themselves to be judged by other users</li>
<li> A smaller nearby island is <b>Datalounge</b></li></ul></li>
<li> An island containing gaming-related sites
<ul><li> <b>D2JSP</b></li>
<li> <b>EA UK</b></li>
<li> <b>Gametrailers</b></li></ul></li>
<li> Smaller islands next to the D2JSP island are
<ul><li> <b>Steam powered</b></li>
<li> <b>World of players</b></li>
<li> <b>Nedgaf</b></li>
<li> <b>Overclock</b></li></ul></li>
<li> A smaller island of regional and special-interest forums:
<ul><li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://digitalspy.com/">Digital Spy</a></b>, a British media and entertainment news service</li>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.onliner.by/">onliner.by</a></b>, a Belarusian digital technology forum</li>
<li> Zona Ford</li>

<li> exbil</li>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.macrumors.com/">MacRumors</a></b>, an Apple news and discussion site</li>
<li> Adjacent to this, an island labelled <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/">Whirlpool Forums</a></b>, a large Australian broadband and technology forum. The drawing reflects Australia being an island continent separated from other countries.</li></ul></li>
<li> An island made up of several European forums:
<ul><li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jlaforums.com/">JLA Forums</a></b></li>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fok.nl/">fok.nl</a></b>, a Dutch forum site that is one of the largest internet communities in the Netherlands</li>

<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.forum.hr/">forum.hr</a></b>, a Croatian forum</li>
<li> <b>rus-chat</b>, possibly a reference to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://rus-chat.de/">rus-chat.de</a></li></ul></li>
<li> The largest single-site island is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.somethingawful.com/">SomethingAwful</a>, a website that is meant to showcase all things "awful". SomethingAwful also has a large trollbase, but they tend to be more honorable than the ones from Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan. One example is there being a spotty holding of the no-furries rule in the forums. The forums themselves are famous because of the holding of the Let's Plays of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lparchive.org/Dangan-Ronpa/">Dangan Ronpa</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://danganronpa2mirror.tumblr.com/">Super Dangan Ronpa 2</a>, which had cooked up public interest to the point of there being an English-language release of the games. (Note that, due to these Let's Plays being in a forums that frequently hides behind a "paywall" that requires a paid account before accessing, the links provided go to their mirrors.)</li></ul>

<dd>Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the Spring and Summer of 2010.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is "Facebook" - with large states in the south-east of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, &amp; Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>To the southwest of Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and /b/. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The northeastern third of Gossip/Political/Tech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.] </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.]</dd>
<dd>ABOUT THIS MAP</dd>
<dd>Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing, sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some comparing of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wikipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.</dd></dl>

<p>I believe I can explain why the e-mail, SMS and Internet areas of the map are surrounded by the "Spoken Language" country. Yes, SMS, e-mail and most of the Internet are "written", but they're more of a "written spoken language", sharing many traits with informal spoken language. Maybe Wikipedia articles and blog posts can be classified as "standard written texts", but most other forms of electronically-mediated communication bare more resemblance to the way we speak: forums, chatrooms, Facebook posts, SMS texts, the usage of acronyms and smiley faces, etc. It's a widely researched phenomenon, and it continues to be a topic in the fields of linguistics, psychology, sociology and education (literacy attainment). As an aspiring linguist myself, I smiled when I noticed that these so-called "written" forms were next to spoken language&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.215.10" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.215.10">108.162.215.10</a> 22:16, 22 December 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>about the Catbus Route on 4chan island in the Forums inset: Might it have something to do with the catbus in the animated film Totoro?  In the film, the bus appears to have a regular route, or at least standard bus stops. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.40" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.40">108.162.219.40</a> 07:55, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

</p><p>Is there an explanation of why the Twitter area more or less resembles the shape of US/Mexico? If you have a look at the Youtube area then there's Alaska, too. And since Justin Bieber is Canadian and the "Bieber Bay" seems to resemble the Great Lakes...

</p><p>I looked, couldn't find anything about the Hidden Internet, Dark Web, Deep Web, etc. I sort of imagine it looks like a deep chasm or river (Styx?) to another world with the likes of the NSA, Wikileaks, Electronic Frontier Foundation on the outskirts.

</p><p>In what way is this explanation "incomplete" still?! It's marked as today's "incomplete explanation of the day" but it's already sixteen printed pages long. How much more content does there need to be before this site will consider this page to no longer be "incomplete?"

</p><p>MMO is not short for MMORPG. It's just not. MMO means Massively Multiplayer Online. Like Dota 2, which is in no way an RPG. Or maybe Realm of the Madgod. Also not and RPG, but YES an MMO. that little gripe having been posted publicly, however, I've just realized that even if it's the day's incomplete article, nothing's going to happen, so fair warning: I'm going to do it meself.

</p><p>Annoying pedant again, here with another annoyingly pedantic statement. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1405/">https://xkcd.com/1405/</a>)
RPG is short for ROLe PLAYING GAME. NOT "ROLE PLAYER GAME" It doesn't matter now, because I fixed it, but if someone who doesn't understand the difference between MMO and MMORPG, they can at least remember to fix "Role Player Game."
Annoying Pedant out. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.92.128" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.92.128">162.158.92.128</a> 10:54, 5 February 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>It seems like this comic has been "incomplete" for all eternity. This comic is in the "Incomplete explanation spotlight" more than ANY OTHER COMIC. The thing's huge! That's natural! I say this explanation does a pretty good job of explaining most if not every grating detail about this comic! I think we should use the Incomplete Spotlight for comic explanations that are ACTUALLY BAD. So can we stop giving this explanation grief for maybe leaving out a few 5-pixel towns? Thank you and stop fussing.

<dl><dd> No. If an explanation is incomplete, an explanation should be edited until the point where it is as complete as possible. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.86" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.86">141.101.104.86</a> 16:04, 24 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'm not arguing that. I'm saying that there are other explanations that are more incomplete than this one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.56" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.56">108.162.219.56</a> 21:04, 26 April 2016 (UTC)
