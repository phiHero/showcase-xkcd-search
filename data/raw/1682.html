<p>In this comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> is teaching a class about an animal referred to as a "bun". The word "bun" is short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bunny">bunny</a>, which is in turn an informal term used for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rabbit">rabbit</a>. The comic depicts a childish response to seeing a cute animal, but coming from an adult. The humor in the comic comes from a tone of absurdity in a classroom situation where lectures are expected to be serious.
</p><p>The lecture opens with the statement that smaller buns are superior in rank, which is plainly false.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> Instead, the teacher clearly thinks that smaller bunnies are just cuter. She mentions that "king buns" may be seen around this time of year, which refers to rabbit kittens being born in the spring. Kittens would be smaller and cuter than any other rabbits because of their age. There is no mention of a "queen bun", but the gender of the kitten can be difficult to determine without a close examination. A prime example of a king bun can be seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/HicMr/">here</a>.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a>, who attends this biology class, expected to learn about rabbits and hares which are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorpha" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lagomorpha">lagomorphs</a>, a mammalian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Order (biology)">order</a> that also includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pika">pikas</a>. Megan thus clearly has the correct understanding of what a "bun" is. Ponytail then claims that the word <i>bun</i> is the scientific term, and states that rabbit, hare, and lagomorph are informal ways to describe these animals, again being completely wrong as in reality <i>bun</i> is the most contracted and informal name for a rabbit.
</p><p>Two students are then legitimately doubting that they're in the correct class and decide to check online (either the crude theories that Ponytail expressed, or their course schedule). A third student however appears to believe the lecturer uncritically, reminding the fellow students that they're looking upon the image of a king (i.e. a cute bunny).
</p><p>The title text refers to photographing a rabbit and, for example, posting it on social media - something which would typically be done today if someone sees a cute rabbit in the wild. If the poster had failed to photograph the rabbit before it ran away, they may typically post a message saying something like "I saw a really cute bunny today!" with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Emoji">emoji</a> depiction of a rabbit (probably 🐇 or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.amazon.com/WEP-Emoticon-Cushion-Stuffed-Colorful/dp/B01EMBET4A">🐰</a>). This is especially common in the area where <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> lives, as the urban rabbit population in the Cambridge/Somerville area has exploded, putting a large human population with relatively little previous experience with rabbit-sightings suddenly in the position of encountering them very frequently.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> Emoji have become a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Emoji" title="Category:Emoji">recurrent theme</a> on xkcd.
</p><p>Ponytail tells that buns have a hierarchy in which the smaller the bun, the higher its ranking is - a rank-size distribution. A "king bun" can be seen as an instance of the king effect, the phenomenon where the top one or two members of a ranked set show up as outliers. An interesting linguistic note is that in several languages (including Russian, German, Czech and Polish), the word for rabbit literally means "little king".

<p>I assumed this was about hair buns, am I incorrect? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.25" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.25">173.245.54.25</a> 11:10, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I also believed that 'bun' was also referring to hair buns/ponytails, thus giving a visual pun to the comic. It would also add another level of the 'heirarchy' pun as well. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.56.25" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.56.25">173.245.56.25</a> 14:08, 18 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I think it's "bun" short for "bunny", an informal term meaning a rabbit (especially a cute one such as the ones shown in the comic). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.130" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.130">141.101.98.130</a> 11:16, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Wolves don't actually have as strong a hierarchical structure as commonly believed, and don't have so-called "alphas" running the pack. Wolf packs are primarily a family structure that centers around the parents, in a natural non-tyrannical way, with different wolves making decisions and leading the pack at various times depending on their particular skills. For more information on this, refer to writings by David Mech, wolf biologist, who first coined the terms "alpha" and "omega" for wolves, and has for years been trying to convince people that those original theories are incorrect.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.24" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.24">108.162.221.24</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.221.24&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.221.24 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>Of course, 'buns' are also a euphemism for butt, which might clarify a thing or two, or at least add a more amusing context.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.42" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.42">141.101.104.42</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.104.42&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.104.42 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>I also believe the comic makes more sense when taking that meaning (bun for buttocks/derrière...) into account. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.150.230" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.150.230">162.158.150.230</a> 12:53, 18 May 2016 (UTC)J
</p><p>Except for the fact in the very first frame Ponytail uses it in the singular while using the pointer to draw attention to an image of an animal. Has *anyone* used 'bun' in its singular form to refer to buttocks? 'Bum', perhaps, but not 'bun'. Given the rest of the panel's contextual talk regarding the 'buns', that particular interpretation never entered my thoughts. I wonder if the interpretation regarding the derrière is seen more by those of a certain age, generation or geographic group, i.e: the way soda, cola, pop, 'soft drink' and Coke are regional and/or generational terms for a sugary carbonated drink product. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.69.36" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.69.36">162.158.69.36</a> 07:01, 27 November 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I know that this is absolutely just a personal gripe, but the website is called explain xkcd, not spell-out-everything-that-happens-in-xkcd. 
</p><p>In relevance, this seems to be satire of current-gen's obsession with (mis)spelling things that are cute incorrectly (see: smol, birb, doge) and the situation in the comic is a role-reversal, with the teacher being a (teen/tween/memer etc.) and the students are questioning the teacher's professionalism. 
</p><p>The point about 'rank' could of course be some fictional idea that a younger person could attach to a physical entity to make the world more fun and interesting or something idk.
I would add this theory, of course, but i have no idea what i'm even reading when i read this explanation and don't know where to add it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.161" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.161">108.162.250.161</a> 12:00, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>In the fictional rabbit-world of "Watership Down", larger rabbits are usually superior. However the story is about an unusual group in which a small rabbit, Fiver, is the "king."

<p>Smaller "buns" being higher valued -- confirms to me the reference to (male) buttocks -- but what no one else seems to have noticed is that "mammalogy" is a short distance from the non-word "mammology" (cf. mammogram) would be the study of breasts, another viewable body part. So the presumed confusion could be confused with mammalogy / mammology.... <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Asimong" title="User:Asimong">Asimong</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Asimong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Asimong (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:29, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Most of the explanations posted thus far seem off-the-mark to me. Especially the ones involving butts, I mean, c'mon... The comment above about "role-reversal" gets close to the heart of the joke (if any), though I think more than anything this strip is just Randall indulging his love for depicting people in roles of presumed authority spouting absurdities. (And for tiny bunnies, of course.) TBH, though, this one mainly gives the impression of being based on a private joke or conversation, or just referencing some meme I haven't seen yet.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.68.35" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.68.35">162.158.68.35</a> 16:14, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

<p>I would say the entire "buttocks" link that is currently reflected in the description is a very poor fit. Clearly "this time of year" is referring to spring, when rabbits are most commonly seen darting around, and when rabbit kittens are most likely to be born/leave their nests. "The image of a king" clearly has nothing to do with Ponytail, as there is an image of a "king bun" on the screen. This is most definitely a reference to the treatment of images of monarchy. For example, in the UK it is illegal to deface images of the Queen. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fendletruck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fendletruck (page does not exist)">Fendletruck</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fendletruck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fendletruck (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:49, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I concur. Delete any reference to explanation about buttocks, and only state that some may think of this, but given that there are images of bunnies this is probably more saying of the person who thinks of butts than of Randall...&#160;;-) I will leave it up to others to do the deletion though. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 18:04, 18 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Wondering if there's any tie in to the ancient but not quite defunct alt.devilbunnies, which was about evils buns, their cuteness, and people under their evil sway. The teacher in this case would clearly qualify as a "symp" (bunny sympathizer). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.77" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.77">108.162.219.77</a> 17:28, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Just to be clear, there are studies which show that cuteness in humans has certain evolutionary advantages for human babies and may affect how humans treat animals they perceive as cute. I was tempted to expound more upon this in the explanation but the explanation is no place for that. Cuteness in animals is both relative and a perception, it is subject to change from person to person based on past experiences and preferences, it is also affected by hormones and mood. It is not a defense mechanism, it does not protect against predators. I know the edit which first mentioned the fitness advantages of cuteness didn't state that it does protect against predators but in my original edit, where I first mentioned fitness, I was trying to include information relevant to the comic, not information which was absolutely correct. And even cuteness doesn't protect rabbits from human poaching as much as conservation does. In most places rabbits are pests and are dealt with just as rats and mice are now. But since I know that if I include information which is not one hundred percent absolutely correct in all situations it will eventually get edited, even if it makes the explanation clearer, I will not include this at the moment, to spare the exhaustive detail it will inevitably spawn.
</p><p>In short, rabbits are delicious and things like to eat them, no matter how cute they may be. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lackadaisical" title="User:Lackadaisical">Lackadaisical</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lackadaisical" title="User talk:Lackadaisical">talk</a>) 18:40, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd> It's a mother getting excited about a cute thing and gushing about it. (And pestering her friends about it on social media.) Smaller buns 'rank' higher because their smallness makes them cuter in the eyes of the beholder (regardless of what the actual rabbits think about it).

<dl><dd> Thank you, I see what you mean. But I'm not convinced it's what Randall meant: his strips don't tend to be about parents, and if he wanted us to make that particular connection then I think he would have added much stronger signals.

It feels like the comic is intentionally reversing several concepts rather than simply giving nonsense (higher rank is normally larger and level formality is reversed)  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.92" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.92">141.101.98.92</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.98.92&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.98.92 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>I, too, immediately picked up an undertone about butts.  "This time of year" being spring, ladies often start wearing skirts and shorts after mostly longer clothes in the winter (especially in Mass. where Randall lives), and the occasional "bun" sighting is in fact a recognized annual recurrence.  I think it has a place in the explanation as at least a wink-and-nod double entendre.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.52" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.52">108.162.219.52</a> 17:09, 19 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Not all of his comics are done for humor, some are simply absurd. I think this is one of those ones which is simply absurd. Unfortunately within the first few days of a comic coming out it is unlikely that the explanation here will be complete or have any form of consistent tone or style. It will be debated and edited back and forth. Some will be over analyzed to the point that any humor or consistency will be strained out of them. It is better to wait a week or so for the buzz around a new comic to die down. In fact, I usually avoid the newest comics but, I happen to like rabbits. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lackadaisical" title="User:Lackadaisical">Lackadaisical</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lackadaisical" title="User talk:Lackadaisical">talk</a>) 23:53, 19 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

</p><p>As for Slavic word for rabbit meaning "Little King". I'm Czech myself, so I looked around for the etymology; found something on Czech wikipedia (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kr%C3%A1l%C3%ADk_dom%C3%A1c%C3%AD#Etymologie">https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kr%C3%A1l%C3%ADk_dom%C3%A1c%C3%AD#Etymologie</a>), posting translated for your consideration:
(King - "král"; Rabbit - "králík", "-ík" can be used as a diminutive suffix, for example with "kůň" - horse, "koník" - little horse)
What does a rabbit to do with a king? Nothing, actually, but the words are still related. As rabbits were not native animals in Bohemia, our ancestors didn't have a name for them. When first rabbits were brought to Bohemia from Germany 13th-14th century, we also got their German name "das Kaninchen", a corruption of the Latin word "cuniculus". Because of phonetic similarity, the word "Kaninchen" was mixed with "Königchen", the diminutive form of "der König" - king, and the Czech word "králík" was born.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.95.43" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.95.43">141.101.95.43</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.95.43&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.95.43 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>Czech and Russian are quite alike indeed. But in Russian there is no way a word for rabbit (кролик) be read as 'Little King', these aren't omonims either. For 'King' there's a word "Король" [kɐ.ˈro.lʲ] if you will use appropriate diminutive suffix, which is "-ёк" [ʲɵk] , you will end up with "Королёк" [kərɐˈlʲɵk] - 'kinglet' (a bird of Regulidae family) that is not a bunny, although it's really small too. Same as male horse - "Конь" [ˈkonʲ] belittles to word "Конёк" [kɐˈnʲɵk] and has a second meaning - 'roof skate'. 
Well, one may combine russian word "Кроль" [kro.'lʲ] meaning either 'male rabbit' (depricated) or 'crawl' swimming style (modern), with diminutive "-ик" [ˈʲɪk] suffix and result will be "Кролик" [ˈkrolʲɪk] - 'Bunny' but in case of second meaning that's simply a pun.
So no, not in Russian, as source word was Polish "królik" which was formed same as Czech "králík".  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.80.35" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.80.35">141.101.80.35</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.80.35&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.80.35 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>At the risk of adding to the noise, I assumed the joke was in the course name: confusing the study of "mammals" with the study of "memes". Everything being taught is a memetic concept (in the modern sense of the word, at least). It seems the path of least resistance in terms of making the smallest change to turn an understandable scene into an absurd one. Randall uses this format a lot (i.e: the entire scene &amp; meaning being changed simply by changing one key word). He's very punny. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.249.156" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.249.156">108.162.249.156</a> 00:37, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

I was seeing bun as used in an online sort of "omigod look at the bun" kind of usage. Honestly, visit tumblr for a few minutes, search the tag #bun, everyone uses bun for bunny, rabbit, hare, etc. The hierarchy I thought was to be based on cuteness level, as the smaller the bun, the more bun is respected in these online circles, or by anyone, really. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.111" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.111">162.158.255.111</a> 02:01, 29 May 2016 (UTC)
