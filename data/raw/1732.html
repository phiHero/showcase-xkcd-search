<p><br /> 
This comic is a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Timelines" title="Category:Timelines">timeline</a> on how the temperature has changed from 20,000 BCE (Before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Common Era">Common Era</a>) to the present day (2016), with three predictions for the rest of the 21st century depending on what actions are taken (or not taken) to stop CO₂ emission. This comic is a direct, but much more thorough, follow up on the previous global warming comic: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1379:_4.5_Degrees" title="1379: 4.5 Degrees">1379: 4.5 Degrees</a>. By having readers scroll through millennia of slow-paced natural changes, Randall uses the comic to confront the rapid temperature rise in recent years. 
</p><p>Over the past 100 years, human action has produced a large amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO%E2%82%82_emissions" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:CO₂ emissions">CO₂ emissions</a>, which have caused a rise in average global temperature through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Global warming">global warming</a> and is part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Climate change">climate change</a>, a subject that has become a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Climate_change" title="Category:Climate change">recurrent subject</a> on xkcd. There are still many people who claim that this is not happening, or at least that it is not caused by any human actions, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Climate change denial">climate change deniers</a>. One argument of theirs is that global warming is happening for natural causes, summarized with the phrase "temperature has changed before".
</p><p>This comic shows that while temperature changes have indeed occurred before, the speed of the current temperature rise is much, much faster than those measured for many previous thousands of years. The comic became so popular that <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> <a href="#Popularity_of_comic">postponed the release</a> of his next comic to keep this one on the front page one day longer. 
</p><p>The temperature curve is a dotted line most of the time, but from about 1850 to 2016 the measurement data is good enough to let the curve become a solid line indicating that this is not an estimate. Before 1850 the temperature is an estimate based on the <a href="#Sources">sources</a> given. And likewise into the future the three possible curves are also dotted to show that they are predictions, based on how seriously the population of Earth takes knowledge (and comics) like this.
</p><p>Although this is a topic Randall obviously takes very seriously, and by far most of the facts fit with known history, he still includes several <a href="#Jokes_in_the_comic">jokes in the comic</a>. See also the <a href="#Table_of_all_elements">table</a> explaining each item in the comic. After the election of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> for president later the year of this comic's release, it is possible that Randall believes that his worst fears (as expressed by the current path at the bottom) will hold up, with the actions taken by the new president.
</p><p>The title text compares the saying that "the temperature has changed before" comparing temperature changes over thousands of years to the rapid global warming over the last century with saying that the "small" changes to the temperature a car experiences over the years of normal usage should not make you worried over the rapid temperature increase that happens when someone sets your car on fire. Randall previously used this joke in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1693:_Oxidation" title="1693: Oxidation">1693: Oxidation</a>.

<ul><li> By placing the invention of the internet at 1980 in the chart, just where the temperature curve starts its most rapid increase, Randall humorously implies that the internet caused the rise in temperature.</li>
<li> At 13600 BCE a glacier is shown retreating from New York because of the warm up. It is disgusted by the new changes and proclaims: <i>That’s it! I’m moving to Canada!</i> This is a joke on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/want-to-move-to-canada-if-trump-wins-not-so-fast-100658/">an idiom said by US citizens</a> to protest against changes in their country. As shown in the chart, the glacier takes 5000 years (13600-8400 BCE) to cross what would become the Canadian border (neither the United States nor Canada existed yet). Also, glaciers don't speak English, or any language for that matter.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li> At 13400 BCE it is mentioned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_domestic_dog" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Origin of the domestic dog">humans domesticate dogs</a>. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> talks to a wolf about to be tamed making a deal with it, that it can eat and sleep with the humans as long as they can yell at it for pooping indoors. This sounds like a sweet deal for the wolf until <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> mentions that they will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breeding" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dog breeding">breed</a> it to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chihuahua (dog)">very small</a> and then dress it up in small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog%27s_fashion" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dog&#39;s fashion">costumes</a>. The wolf says wait, but it is already too late...</li>
<li> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon">Pokémon</a> reference at 9000 BCE about them going extinct in North America (although Megan does proclaim that this is not a real fact). As the writing stated that <i>Pokémon go extinct</i> this can also be seen as a reference to a popular video game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon Go">Pokémon Go</a> and hence also the comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1705" class="mw-redirect" title="1705">1705: Pokémon Go</a>.</li>
<li> At 4500 BCE, next to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European language</a> develops", <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> gets the idea to develop the language heavily inflected to make it difficult to remember all the verb endings for future students. This is a direct reference to the comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1709:_Inflection" title="1709: Inflection">1709: Inflection</a>.</li>
<li> The reference to the 1984 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> about the fake rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:This Is Spinal Tap">This Is Spinal Tap</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> at 2200 BCE. In the movie the band ordered a giant 18 feet Stonehenge megalith but a writing mistake gives them one that is only 18 inches high.
<ul><li>Another real band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> is referenced 16000 BCE where Megan writes the bands stylized name NIИ on the wall next to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairy" title="Hairy">Hairy</a> who is in the process of painting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cave painting">cave painting</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lascaux">Lascaux</a> in France.</li></ul></li>
<li> Around the setting of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Iliad">Iliad</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Odyssey">Odyssey</a> (1200 BCE) a drawing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Trojan Horse">Trojan Horse</a> has writing on it that states: <i>Not a trap</i>. </li>
<li> Just below the previous entry also at 1200 BCE is the mentioning of the invasion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sea Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>. This sounds so much like a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mermaid">mermaids</a>, often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid#One_Thousand_and_One_Nights" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mermaid">sea people</a> that Randall feels the need to note that this invasion and these sea people is <i>a real thing</i> in a footnote. This is opposed to the Pokémon reference above where he notes that it is <i>not a real fact</i>. The sea people was a seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt and other Bronze age civilizations around this time. It is widely regarded to be one of the major causes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Late Bronze Age collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>.</li>
<li> The reference at 450 BCE compares the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Battle of Thermopylae">Battle of Thermopylae</a> (also known as 300 Spartans) with the dramatized 2007 movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:300 (film)">300</a></i>, but in the real world the fighting of course occurred <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/FCfdyroV7kc?t=12">at regular speed and with more clothing</a>.</li>
<li>There are other minor jokes but this list mentions all the major jokes.</li></ul>

This is half the temperature change experienced since the ice age, but the other way.

<td> In this last scary scenario Randall assumes the temperature keeps rising steadily by extrapolating along the slope of the last two to three years. Randall has warned about the hazards of <a href="/wiki/index.php/Extrapolating" class="mw-redirect" title="Extrapolating">Extrapolating</a>, but this line is in fact <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-best-to-worst-case-scenarios.html">below the worst case predictions</a>. If this comes true we will reach a temperature increase taking us from the 1961-1990 average and in just 125 years to 4.2°C above this average. That is just as far above this average in that short time span as the ice age temperature was below. And it took more than 11,000 years for nature to reach such an increase. Randall already contemplated what this would be like in the +1 ice age unit (IAU) panel of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1379:_4.5_Degrees" title="1379: 4.5 Degrees">1379: 4.5 Degrees</a> two years ago, as well as in <a href="/wiki/index.php/164:_Playing_Devil%27s_Advocate_to_Win" title="164: Playing Devil&#39;s Advocate to Win">164: Playing Devil's Advocate to Win</a> almost 10 years ago. He may get to <i>enjoy quite a ride</i> as he "wished" for back then.
<p>There is no reason to assume the temperature will not keep rising past 2100 CE, so the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous_Thermal_Maximum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cretaceous Thermal Maximum">"Hothouse Earth"</a> of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous_period" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cretaceous period">Cretaceous period</a> mentioned in the 4.5 degree comics +2 IAU panel might come to pass in future centuries if we continue on our current path. On the bright side, modern civilization might collapse if this trend keeps up, which would drastically cut our releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. But then again, positive feedback from methane in melting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Permafrost">permafrost</a> might take over... Good luck Earth.

<dd>When people say “The climate has changed before,” these are the kinds of changes they’re talking about.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[A very long chart below the headings above is headed with a label for the scale of the X-axis above the chart. Below that a sub-caption. To the left an arrow down to the top of the chart pointing to the dotted curves starting point (at -4.3°C below the 1961-1990 average) with a label above the arrow. And arrow pointing left to the left of the center and another pointing right to the right of the center has labels. Below these is the temperature scale of the X-axis, with 9 ticks between the borders each with a label ranging from -4 to +4°C compared to the 1961-1990 average, but with another step in each direction not labeled towards to axis so the chart covers -5 to +5°C compared to the 1961-1990 average.]</dd>

<dl><dd>[The chart is split in 10 columns by the temperature scale and the borders. The two central columns are white, and then from there to the left the background becomes a faded color that changes from light blue to blue at the edge in four steps. Similarly to the right the color changes from light red to red. To the left there is a time scale taking 500 years leaps from 20,000 BCE all the way to year 1, where there are two years, one for BBC and one for CE. The 500 year leaps continue until 1500 CE and from there the steps are down to 100 years until 2100 with also present day 2016 labeled. After 1500 the CE is omitted. The labels stop there, but there is space below covering down to 2200 CE. There is clearly visible division line across the chart on the level of each of the 500 step, and fainter lines for each of the 100 steps all the way even though only the last 5 of these 100 steps are labeled. There is a similar clear line at 2016. Below each step on the Y-axis is noted, and then any text starting before the next step is noted below indented. If there are extra image belonging to text this is indented once more. The graph that the whole chart is about is a dotted line that begins at the “start” point mentioned above at -4.3°C and then begins to go straight down. It will change left and right all the way down. To being with all text and most drawings are to right of the dotted curve. Whenever something is to the left it will be noted. When it says to the left above something, and then nothing over the next, then the next will be to the right. Only at the very bottom are there more entries to the left than right. ]</dd>

<ul><li>There have been several <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Large_drawings" title="Category:Large drawings">large drawings</a></i> in the history of xkcd, some of which are bigger than this one (for instance <a href="/wiki/index.php/1110:_Click_and_Drag" title="1110: Click and Drag">1110: Click and Drag</a>). 
<ul><li>Among those that can be viewed in one go, without downloading a larger file or moving around, this is by far the longest.</li>
<li>The next longest is probably <a href="/wiki/index.php/482:_Height" title="482: Height">482: Height</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>The timeline starts at 20,000 BCE (22,000 years ago) and ends at 2100 CE, thus covering 22,100 years. </li>
<li>There are several spelling mistakes. 
<ul><li>Most obvious is the second time Randall wrote the word "Iliad," because he just spelled it correctly at 1500 BCE and then spelled it <i>Illiad</i> at 1000 BCE with two "L"s.</li>
<li>Attila the Hun becomes <i>Atilla the Hun</i> with <i>one</i> T and <i>two</i> L's.</li>
<li>Pokémon is spelled <i>Pokemon</i>, but then again, that is not so strange for Randall (see <a href="/wiki/index.php/1647:_Diacritics" title="1647: Diacritics">1647: Diacritics</a>). Despite that, he usually spells it correctly, as in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1705" class="mw-redirect" title="1705">1705: Pokémon Go</a>.</li>
<li>Note that the fact that woolly rhinoceros becomes <i>Wooly rhino</i> with only one l is not a spelling mistake but an alternative spelling of the word.</li></ul></li>
<li>The following notable facts are absent
<ul><li>1850: methodical temperature record begins. However, this fact is indirectly indicated when the temperature curve becomes solid around 1850 and until present day.</li>
<li>The entire swing period between 20 and 200 thousand years prior to now would depict temperature swings with increasing frequency and amplitude (ref geological record). But of course, this could not be included in a comic that only goes back to 20,000 BCE. </li>
<li>During much of the 300 million years prior to that, the Earth was significantly warmer than now. However, the data's temporal precision decreases with age; seemingly abrupt changes millions of years ago might have happened over centuries or millennia. Hence, the older data is not usable to compare rates of change.</li></ul></li></ul>

</p><p>Saying the "dotted line comes from computer models" is a bit inaccurate. Prehistoric temperature reconstructions are based on lots of measurements from lots of places around the planet: ice cores, lake and ocean sediments, etc. which are the best proxy records of climate change.

<dl><dd>Actually we don't know what the shifts were on that scale in the past. The dotted line before modern measurement is a very limited estimate. We have no idea what the year to year changes were in the past, at best we can work out an average.

<dl><dd>Randall explicitly addresses your specious complaint at 15900 BCE. Year-to-year fluctuations are not the same as the current century-long surge.

<dl><dd>No it is not that which is the problem, but that you try to disqualify the data without even bothering to look through them. Aa mentioned Randall tries to let us know that such a high fluctuation as we have in these last 100 years would not be hidden in the old data. As mentioned by Fankie this is explained between 16000 and 15500 BCE... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:30, 14 September 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I refuse to debate a matter of faith with you. Note that 15500-16000 is 500 years, perhaps when we have 500 years of accurate temperature measurements we will know more. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.119" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.119">108.162.246.119</a> 03:54, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm not surprised that you can't even read a chart. 16000-15500 BCE is where the explanation is placed on the chart. The fluctuations he shows that would not register are small fluctuations over a decade or two. A fluctuation of a century would "unlikely" be smoothed out.

<dd><a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Frankie" title="User:Frankie">Frankie</a>, funny how the nonaveraged plots [and even the averaged plot] <a href="#wikimedia">linked</a> to below invalidates Randall's plot, "Hence the comparison is not comparing like with like and is scientifically invalid."  The temperature rate between 1859 (coincident with America's discovery of petroleum and the Carrington Event) and today does not exceed that within the past 2,000, 20,000, or 100,000s of years.  The present surge (the tip of the "hockey stick") concerns not 100 years but almost 40 years (36 years in Randall's plot) which does not successfully meet the three fluctuation disclaimers.  As mentioned in the Wikimedia discussion the temperature resolution is about 300 years; therefore it should take another 150 years to see whether this slope corrects itself. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Lysdexia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Lysdexia (page does not exist)">Lysdexia</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Lysdexia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Lysdexia (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:04, 5 January 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Is nobody else having a problem seeing the comic? Both here and on XKCD I get an "Image not found" icon, a blue question mark. I thought maybe this was an interactive comic that doesn't work on my iPad (like that garden thing, though that did nothing on my computer either). If I tap it on XKCD nothing happens, here it leads to the picture's Wiki page - also with the question mark - which says it's a PNG, which I know this iPad can show. It's 11pm EST, maybe night maintenance on XKCD? Or the file got renamed without updating the sites? - NiceGuy1 <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.126.227" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.126.227">162.158.126.227</a> 03:12, 14 September 2016 (UTC) I finally signed up!

<dl><dd>It's weird that I got what is clearly an "Image not found" icon, though. Maybe my 1st Gen iPad's Safari saw the file, decided "No way I'm loading that!"(or "that size can't be right", LOL!) and chose to show the error icon instead. When I force the issue, by going directly to the image URL listed on XKCD, the first time Safari crashed rather than load the image (but it crashes on a regular basis, so that didn't deter me), the second time it crashed, the third time it actually loaded, and I was able to see it. After seeing mentions here of spelling errors (though I have to disagree on "Pokemon", generally only people connected to the show bother with the accent.

<p>Okay, now that I've managed to SEE the damn thing, I have a question. There's no mention of why this is using "BCE" and "CE" instead of the standard "BC" and "AD", never mind what these stand for (thinking and thinking about it, my guess is "Before Christ Era" and "Christ Era"). This is the kind of thing that should be mentioned on ExplainXKCD, LOL! Fun fact: when I searched this page for "BCE", to confirm it wasn't explained, I got "Over 100 matches".&#160;:) Anyway, I figure maybe those are currently accepted scientific terminology, especially since "AD" is Latin, unlike "BC", but the average person still uses BC and AD. In fact, I think this is the first time I've ever seen BCE and CE (unless it's been on XKCD before and I just dismissed it as a typo or something. This time there are WAY too many for it to be a mistake every time, including here in the explanation!) - NiceGuy1<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.218.239" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.218.239">108.162.218.239</a> 21:20, 14 September 2016 (UTC) I finally signed up!

<dl><dd>It's "Before Common Era" and "Common Era", an alternative to BC/AD.

<dl><dd>I assume nothing. My statements are completely accurate. I OBSERVE it is the standard, the only standard anybody (else) seems to use. BC/AD is the "standard" because it is standard practice to use it. For good reason, since I would estimate just about everybody knows what it means, while I am sure I am in the majority in having never heard BCE/CE. It is also not "my" way, I made no choice here, it is the established convention, it is the way accepted and adopted by society. While I would normally be more inclined towards terminology devoid of religion (as seems to be the point here, now that someone kindly clarified these acronyms for me), I feel this would be a losing fight, one it would be foolish to attempt, the classic terminology is too ingrained in society.

<p>What this comic doesn't show is what kind of changes occurred in the previous interglacial period as opposed to the current one.  Since the current one is not yet over there could still be a stage of an interglacial with rapid temperature rise which we are only now reaching, but has happened in previous interglacial periods.

<p>I think this would be first time where I see global thermonuclear war described as "best case scenario". There was and still is lot of discussion about how much is current warming caused by humans, but that's not important. Important question is "can we stop it?" and the answer is "not without literally billions of dead" (and even that might not suffice). Any money currently used for most plans to reduce CO2 (which usually fails to reduce CO2, not speaking about global warming, but succeed in their main goal, which is moving the money into pockets of their proponents) would be better spent on ADAPTING to the change. Only plans for reducing CO2 actually worth doing are the ones related to stopping burning fossil fuels, because we will soon need fossil fuels to make food (and other stuff) from. Oh, and also stop burning FOOD. So we should replace fossil fuel power plants with only viable alternative - NUCLEAR. So called renewable power sources like solar are good addition, but doesn't scale to the amount of power and stability we need. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 14:12, 15 September 2016 (UTC)

<p>I understand the concept behind this comic, but why doesn't the graph include atmospheric CO2, sulfur aerosols, and solar 10.7cm radio flux for comparison?  Also, for the person who suggested we look at previous interglacial periods, I may be wrong, but I believe a lot of that data comes from ice cores, that would make it hard to look at time periods before the present ice sheets existed.  IIRC, there were periods not too long ago (geologically speaking) where Antarctica was covered in lakes, tundra, and sparse forests instead of ice sheets.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.65.127" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.65.127">172.68.65.127</a> 05:08, 16 September 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I think the point of comics is that while there were changes in temperature before, they were never this rapid.

<dl><dd>Yeah, the long sample intervals and best fit curves from pre-industrial temperature estimates tend to smooth out any rapid changes that may have occurred over the time period (Think of an ECG/EKG that took a single instantaneuos microvolt sample once every 15 minutes of your life from birth to death, the resulting deflection graph would not look like anything like a normal heart rhythm, but it could be interpreted as the average electrical activity of your heart over the course of a lifetime).  It's true that the rapid climate shifts we are able see in geological records usually coincide with things like supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts.  But those shifts are usually to the negative end from the nuclear winter effect.  Idea for reversing global warming without affecting CO2 emissions, just send a couple of hypervelocity rods or a gravity-tractored asteroid into a dormant supervolcano caldera every few years and... instant winter. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.51.75" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.51.75">173.245.51.75</a> 02:38, 18 September 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Actually.... Solomon and Jesus are not historical figures. Outside the Old and the New Testament, there is no archaeological or other evidence for their existence.

<dl><dd> First, the Guardian is a newspaper, not a science journal. Second, that article is from 2013, before the latest upsurge. Third, even ignoring those things, the article doesn't say what you claim it does. The single most optimistic sentence I see is <i>"If we are lucky, the impact of burning all that oil, coal and gas could turn out to be at the less severe end of the plausible spectrum."</i> The rest of the article is quite pessimistic, such as <i>"it is overwhelmingly likely that we would shoot well past 2C and towards 3C or even 4C of warming."</i></dd>
<dd> Please post exact quotes where your links talk about a better scenario. Please do not post URLs and expect us to figure out what you mean. You are making the claim, the burden of proof is on you. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Frankie" title="User:Frankie">Frankie</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Frankie" title="User talk:Frankie">talk</a>) 17:13, 5 October 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>How do you expect me to quote from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/a/H4prq">the graphs</a>? I can't upload images, maybe I need more edits.

<dl><dd> please explain how the Guardian graph you posted on imgur has to do with better scenarios. The title: "Cuts required for 50% chance of not exceeding 2°C". The footer: "CO2 emissions since 1850 (red); exponential growth (blue); cuts to hit climate target (dashed)." It says that in order to <b>possibly</b> reach the "optimistic" +2° scenario (Randall's 2nd line, not the 1st one), we would need to cut anthropogenic CO2 to about 1/10th our current level, which is ridiculously unlikely to happen. The other graphs you posted are just hypothetical extrapolations about energy production that, even if they're trustworthy (which I doubt) don't reference any climate scenarios at all, much less ones better than the timeline. Until you can post a cogent explanation, I will assume you are trolling and undo your edits. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Frankie" title="User:Frankie">Frankie</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Frankie" title="User talk:Frankie">talk</a>) 17:19, 2 November 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd> If you extrapolate <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://i.imgur.com/G6OSyYE.jpg">[1]</a> to 2023-4, renewables dominate, right? Wind has been in competitive equilibrium with coal since 1995, and solar hit grid parity early this year and is expected to continue falling in price about as fast at least until 2035. Is there any reason to believe fossil fuels won't be abandoned by 2030? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:JSalsman" title="User:JSalsman">JSalsman</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:JSalsman" title="User talk:JSalsman">talk</a>) 02:01, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Exactly zero words in your explanation discuss how the linked graphs show the existence of a better scenario than the ones listed in the timeline. Your very first graph, from the Guardian, explicitly says <b>50% chance of not exceeding 2°C</b>, which is Randall's middle scenario. That means <b>it supports exactly what Randall is saying.</b> It says absolutely nothing about a scenario better than the "best case" timeline. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Frankie" title="User:Frankie">Frankie</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Frankie" title="User talk:Frankie">talk</a>) 21:06, 3 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> Do you understand the words that I am saying? The words that I have been saying from the start of this conversation? I don't f***ing care about pie in the sky energy projects. <b>Even if your energy claims are correct, they don't say a single d**n thing about beating the +1.2°C curve.</b>. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Frankie" title="User:Frankie">Frankie</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Frankie" title="User talk:Frankie">talk</a>) 21:13, 3 November 2016 (UTC)

<blockquote>...So after the election of a climate change denier later in the year of this comic's release, several sad comics have been posted. Some of the reason could be that Randall no longer believes that even his worst fears (as expressed by the current path at the bottom) will hold up, when USA gets a president, who will on purpose act in a way that scientist claims will make the temperature rise even more. See more here.</blockquote>
<p>I've mentioned this on the talk page for <a href="/wiki/index.php/2137:_Text_Entry" title="2137: Text Entry">2137: Text Entry</a>, but I'll reiterate it here: this observation is not factual, not relevant to the explanation, and does not belong in the description of this comic. If you read it in context, you will see that it is also a non-sequitur, clumsily inserted after one or two factual sentences - it does not follow from anything prior in the discussion. It is poorly expressed and the point being made is unclear in any case.
