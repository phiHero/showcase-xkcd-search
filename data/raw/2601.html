<p>This is the 12th <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:April_fools%27_comics" title="Category:April fools&#39; comics">April fools' comic</a> released by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>. The previous April fools' comic was <a href="/wiki/index.php/2445:_Checkbox" title="2445: Checkbox">2445: Checkbox</a>, which was released on Thursday, April 1st, 2021.
</p><p>The comic displays just a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_button" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Radio button">radio button</a> (or option button). Usually, there would be more than one to give the user options. Once it has been selected it cannot be deselected. Once pressed the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/20/2601_Instructions_Radio_on.png">button turns blue</a> and this starts the real part of this April fool's comic.
</p><p>The comic consists of an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/2601/radio.mp3#t=0">audio file</a>. The speech is a mix of <a href="#Index_of_facts">facts about turtles</a> and coding instructions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Logo (programming language)">LOGO</a>.  When executed, the instructions draw an xkcd comic. The audio file is 9 hours and 7 minutes long.

<p>Once the voice begins to describe the instructions (hence the title) it is possible to mute the audio by pressing a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/20/2601_Instructions_Radio_on.png">muted button</a> at the bottom right of the screen. This fades into view when the radio button is pushed. Pressing it will change the button to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/78/2601_Instructions_Radio_on_muted.png">non muted loudspeaker</a>. These were the same buttons that were in the previous April fool's comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/2445:_Checkbox" title="2445: Checkbox">2445: Checkbox</a>. That was the first xkcd <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Comics_with_audio" title="Category:Comics with audio">comic with audio</a>, and thus these were two April fools' comics with audio in a row, and these are the only comics with audio. In the Checkbox comic, the mute buttons meaning are reversed, so the sound is on when the loudspeaker is shown and muted when the mute button is shown. It could be another layer to the April fool's joke or just an error by Randall.
</p><p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/e/e3/20220402201427%21instructions.png">image originally displayed</a> on this page was of a small turtle crawling in the center where the radio button is in the real comic. That was the image that would be downloaded by web crawlers like explain xkcd's bot, as it is what was placed here on xkcd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/instructions_2x.png">https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/instructions_2x.png</a>. This is of course not the real comic, which cannot be downloaded in that manner. 
</p><p>The "turtle" is a key concept in Logo, a programming language especially designed to teach programming to children in an easy way. The turtle in the logo is the cursor. Programming commands move the turtle, drawing a line as it goes. Of course, listening to hours of instructions, including the speech-synthesized reading of source code, is not an easy way to code or draw a picture.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>In addition, at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/2601/radio.mp3#t=32817">the end of the audio</a> the voice says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I even talk to turtles at times, but you need to understand LOGO to appreciate the great, great things that have been created. We spend so much of our life typing, looking, but never ever seeing."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title text alludes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bob Ross">Bob Ross</a>'s catchphrase "happy little trees" in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Joy of Painting">The Joy of Painting</a></i>, a PBS TV show in which Ross leads the viewer through the painting of a nature scene.  The audio file itself is also presented in the style of <i>The Joy of Painting</i>; it begins with greeting the viewer and introducing the color palette to be used (just one color, in this case, as Logo and all computer monitors of the time were monochrome).  The speaker then reads out some helper functions to be used in programming the scene, which is more analogous to Ross's palette of paints (titanium white, carmine red, etc.) along with words of encouragement as each is completed.  The functions are DIST, to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Euclidean distance">Euclidean distance</a> between two points, LERP, to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Linear interpolation">linear interpolation</a>, MIX to average two numbers (with LERP), and CUBIC to draw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cubic Hermite spline">cubic Hermite splines</a>.  From there, the speaker alternates between sketching parts of the scene and offering more words of encouragement, mixed in with turtle facts.
</p><p>Transcribing the audio into text was organized as a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/theinternetftw/xkcd2601">project on github</a>.
</p><p>This is not the first time that Randall made an interactive comic where turtles played a big part, see <a href="/wiki/index.php/1416:_Pixels" title="1416: Pixels">1416: Pixels</a>. In this, he jokes with the idea of turtles all the way down, which is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/2601/radio.mp3#t=10403">also mentioned</a> in the audio file. He also made a comic simply called <a href="/wiki/index.php/889:_Turtles" title="889: Turtles">889: Turtles</a>.

<p>The image drawn by the Logo program is a depiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bob Ross">Bob Ross</a> standing in front of a canvas, on which he has painted "a happy little tree, holding up a happy little world". However, unlike his usual "happy little trees", the tree depicted is not a small pine, but rather a gargantuan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tree" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:World Tree">World Tree</a> growing from the back of a giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Turtle" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:World Turtle">World Turtle</a>, on which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> rests. (The "happy little world" does bear several small pines more typical of his style.) Several ornaments hang from the World Tree, referencing the common practice of hanging ornaments on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_trees" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Christmas trees">Christmas trees</a>.
</p><p>Near the middle of the world, a Cueball sits while listening to the radio, perhaps tuning in to the same transmission that generated the image. Closer to the reader, a turtle is shown walking around, leaving dotted-line tracks behind it, suggestive of the Logo turtle. The dotted-line tracks spell out "TY", shorthand for "thank you" (presumably directed to the readers).
</p><p>At the far top right, a dotted line is shown past which the words "vacuum decay" are written. This is a hypothetical effect in which the universe, being in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastable" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Metastable">metastable</a> state, decays to a true vacuum, and the resulting annihilation of everything expands at the speed of light. As such, humans would have no idea if there were an approaching false vacuum until it arrived at Earth. 
</p><p>At the far left of the image, a robot and human are drawn next to a turtle which has flipped onto its back.  The robot declares, "Poor thing!" while the human says "I'll help".  This is a reference to the "empathy tests" employed to distinguish humans from androids in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a></i> and its film adaptation <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i>.  As part of the test, the listener is asked to imagine being in the desert, flipping a tortoise onto its back, and refusing to turn it back over, while their eyes are monitored for signs of emotional response (or lack thereof).  In this case, the robot expresses sympathy for the turtle and the human declares that he will turn it back over. (In this case, however, the robot is very clearly distinguishable from a human being.)

<dd>Painter: Holding up a happy little world.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[The painting contains lots of stuff. Most notably, an enormous tree with a large, flat top grows on the back of a similarly large turtle at the bottom of the painting, the top of whose shell has been replaced with soil.

<dd>Robot: Poor thing!</dd>
<dd>Cueball: I'll help</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[In the top right corner, there is a dotted line forming a semi-circle around the corner. Inside this are the words:]</dd>

<dl><dd>[The comic consists of one radio button, a small circle in the center of a large white panel. It is interactive. When pressing the radio button (selecting it), it turns blue. The second the radio button is pressed a more than 9-hour long audio file of coding instructions begins to play, and a mute button appears in the bottom right corner. It fades slowly into full opacity. Pressing this button will change it to a loudspeaker. It toggles whether there is sound playing or not. It is not possible to shut down the audio by pressing the radio button. Once selected it cannot be deselected as there is only this one option.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Covered by the radio button is an image of a turtle crawling from left to right, with a dotted line trailing behind it, indicating its movement. This image can only be seen by looking in the place where images for xkcd are usually placed on xkcd.]</dd></dl>

<p>So these are instructions for a turtle graphics program. The audio is drawn from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2601/radio.mp3">https://xkcd.com/2601/radio.mp3</a>, a 9 hour 7 minute 12 second long audio file It's generated by feeding turtle code into a text-to-speech program, but idk which language or which program. If you can convert the speech back to text, somehow without ruining the formatting (or just do a lot of editing with regex until it looks right), you could feed it into a turtle graphics program and get the resulting drawing.
</p>
<dl><dd>If you're not familiar with Turtle and Logo, look at this [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/logo/logo_quick_guide.htm%7Cquick">guide</a>]. The short version is that these commands move a little cursor, called a turtle, which draws a line as it moves and turns. At this time, contributors have applied a few different computer transcriptions to the entire audio. There are quotes about turtles from a variety of sources intermixed with Logo code. It is expected that some correction to the code is needed, such as adding parenthesis that are not spoken in the audio. Standard Logo commands found in the audio are: PENUP, PENDOWN, SETHEADING (N) (N), SETXY (N) (N), and FORWARD (N). Some custom functions are defined, including DIST (N) (N) (N) (N), LERP (N) (N) (N), MIX (N) (N), CUBIC (N) (N) (N) (N), and SQUARE (N) (N). The next steps are to test the transcripts of these custom functions in a Logo interpreter, at which point we can begin drawing the picture. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">Mannerisky</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:45, 2 April 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> The picture indeed will be Bob Ross. The first hour of radio has him saying, "A happy little tree - holding up a happy little world." We can coordinate transcribing this code at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/theinternetftw/xkcd2601">GitHub Repository</a>. Credit for this progress goes to the GitHub owner. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">Mannerisky</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:55, 2 April 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I don't know what the current image on this page is. Is that the drawing you get by following these instructions? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.100.4" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.100.4">172.70.100.4</a> 20:58, 1 April 2022 (UTC)

</p><p>I ran the MP3 through Amazon Transcribe. It can do only 4 hours at a time, so I had to split the original file. I went from start to 03:59:59, 03:59:59 to 07:59:58, and 07:59:58 to end. Amazon Transcribe also gave me some subtitle files (index 1). They have time codes in them. So if someone wanted to note the times of the little quips, and host the audio file somewhere where links to the middle of the file can be generated (like YouTube), that could be cool.

</p><p>So... what language is this? I'm hearing: PENUP, PENDOWN, SETHEADING (N) (N), SETXY (N) (N), FORWARD (N) - all of which are standard LOGO commands. But I'm also hearing something that sounds like CUBIC (N) (N) (N) (N) (N) (N), though it could also be QBIT, or text-to-speech for something like "^3". Either way it's NOT a standard LOGO command, so suggests it's a variant. Does not seem to be KTurtle, POOL, UCBLogo. QLogo, FMSLogo, and then I got bored searching. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.71.91" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.71.91">172.69.71.91</a> 00:37, 2 April 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>In the automatic transcription it has "Two cubic colon X one colon Y one colon X two"... which would be TO CUBIC&#160;:X1&#160;:Y1&#160;:X2  ... so it is defined above. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.107.230" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.107.230">162.158.107.230</a> 01:15, 2 April 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> Yes, some of the commands seem to be defined at the top. CUBIC at the top, SQUARE maybe somewhere else. So a shortcut to decyphering it might be to just extract and render all the cubes from the "CUBIC" and "SQUARE" commands, given their values. But what format are the cubes? Are they even the coordinates of cubes? For both commands, the six numbers seem to be in the format A B A B A B where the As and Bs are similar or even in some cases identical, which seems a strange thing for a cube:</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Given that the audio is generated by text-to-speech, could a source-aware speech-to-text work better (fewer errors and less manual correction) than a generic one? For example, finding the right text-to-speech, extracting a sound for each phoneme, and then searching for near-identical snippets of waveform, seems like it could potentially be more reliable than the generic neural nets which are primarily trained for real human speech. Or even training a neural net on the same text-to-speech source, with a big block of sample data, if that would help distinguish homophones. Presumably someone here is good enough at this sort of thing to try that? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Sqek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sqek (page does not exist)">Sqek</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sqek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sqek (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:05, 2 April 2022 (UTC)
</p><p>I think that the original comment at the top is the best approach.  Using the speech-to-text data posted yesterday, and doing some simple regsubs, I can get it into good enough shape that I can proceed to transcribe the whole program by editing the file while listening to the audio, in real time.  "In real time" means nine hours to correctly transcribe the whole thing.  So any other approach would have to do better than nine hours.  Plus if somebody put a little effort into organization, the transcription can be parallelized and so completed in nine hours / N transcribers. ---Tim <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.38.41" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.38.41">172.70.38.41</a> 13:10, 2 April 2022 (UTC)

A simple approach would be to finetune the model around the hand-transcribed data. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/xloem/4310a26b6c9d13adac14307b948157d3/untitled4.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/gist/xloem/4310a26b6c9d13adac14307b948157d3/untitled4.ipynb</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.114.147" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.114.147">172.70.114.147</a> 23:04, 2 April 2022 (UTC)
</p><p>Any plans to exkcd the "real" comic that gets drawn by the LOGO code in the audio? I mean, I recognize, e. g., the Mars rover and Ursa Major, but what's the significance of the vacuum decay here, for instance? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nitpicking&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nitpicking (page does not exist)">Nitpicking</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nitpicking&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nitpicking (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:18, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Now that the project is complete, we should add the resulting image on this page (not just a link to github). It'll be what folks are looking for first. And then we can start identifying the many references in the picture and turtle quotes. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">Mannerisky</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mannerisky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mannerisky (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:26, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

<dd> Vacuum decay is the total annihilation of the observable universe, which (in theory, depending on details we don't yet know) could happen at any point and at any time and would expand at the speed of light to clobber any space it reaches.  Since it's limited to the speed of light, I guess it wouldn't affect regions of the universe that are receding faster than that.  So, it's a bit of irony contrasting the happy picture.  See <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay</a> .  For an even better explanation, try Katie Mack's excellent book, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Everything-Astrophysically-Speaking/dp/198210354X">https://www.amazon.com/End-Everything-Astrophysically-Speaking/dp/198210354X</a> <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.65" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.65">172.70.110.65</a> 14:13, 6 April 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>It was wonderful watching all of this unfold.  Great work everyone.  I don't have an account here, nor on github, but I thought I'd mention that the makesvg.py uses the ':=' operator which was introduced in python 3.8.  Not all of us have it on our creaky old machines.  Maybe add a comment in the usage at the top of the file?  Or better, refactor the .py?

Is there a trick to making it work?  I've tried both Firefox and Chrome.  I hear the narration and can toggle the mute, but it never draws the picture for me.  I have enabled JavaScript and I have disabled Privacy Badger, NoSCript, and uBlock Origin and still no joy.  I did find the final drawing so I've seen the animation via GIF.

<dl><dd>A function defined above (both in the transcript and, partially, in this Talk page) that is there to define certain smooth lines via a cascade of interesting LOGO procedural code, including branch-tests, that I wasn't even aware could be done until I started to read it.</dd>
<dd>(I mean, I didn't even know LOGO used Polish Notation, having last practically dabbled with it on the probably vastly more limited interpreters that ran on BBC Microcomputers at school, back in the early '80s. You could define procedures with params, but I can't remember this syntax, nor any tests available that seem to suggest recursive tests until the finest changes do nothing.)</dd>
<dd>That was at my first glance, I've avoided the pages until most of the fuss died down because I could see a lot of work being shovelled in, by others, and I knew I couldn't add much but confusion. But I now think I can take leisurely ride through the code and see what I can personally pick up from it.

<p>There should be some statement that there's code and narrative mixed within the transcript; you can't just hand the whole thing to Logo and expect it to work.
</p><p>(Unless, of course, there's some way of telling Logo to ignore a block of text that wouldn't be spoken when you actually read the annotated block. In which case, the transcript needs to be so-annotated. I doubt it, though.)

<dl><dd>The transcript on GitHub prefixes narration by `;` which turns it into a comment that is not parsed by LOGO. It would be cool to have this read out loud like it seems to have been designed: "Bob Ross" talking about painting while "painting" using logo. It'd be something like "Narrate, execute code snippet, narrate, excute code" until the entire picture is done. I noticed, for example, that he talks about drawing a "happy little tree" in between a section of code that, surprise, draws a tree. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.222.151" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.222.151">162.158.222.151</a> 11:23, 4 April 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd> 1. What the transcription page should show. Big, big bonus points if we could have a transcript that, when fed to a "text to speech" tool, would produce exactly what the comic's audio track includes (e.g. no "semicolon Happy Little Tree here")</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> 2. What the output animations should include. What if you'd see a blank canvas, and hear the AI-Bob-Ross narrate, and then watch the code execute and draw? Then, more narration, then more code executing? You could even have the code sections be read out loud, and see the results in real time, It would take a lot of patience to watch the results.
