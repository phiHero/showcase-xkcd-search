<p>This comic uses a similar structure and is based off of the same idea as <a href="/wiki/index.php/1714:_Volcano_Types" title="1714: Volcano Types">1714: Volcano Types</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1874:_Geologic_Faults" title="1874: Geologic Faults">1874: Geologic Faults</a>. Appliance makers sometimes use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">strange screw heads</a> to hinder attempts from users to remove appliance covers. Users usually have handy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwdrivers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Screwdrivers">screwdrivers</a> for the first two screw types drawn, Phillips and Flat. More advanced users usually have some less standard drivers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Torx">Torx</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_key" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Allen key">Allen</a>, however appliance makers keep designing increasingly strange screw heads and users keep acquiring increasingly strange screwdrivers.
</p><p>The comic is about the frustration a user may feel when faced with a screw for which they have no screwdriver. Usually the user will try to fit one of the drivers they have handy into the strange screw, leading to damaging the screw and/or the driver and/or the person wielding the tool.
</p><p>The types of screws listed are the following:

<th> Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> Phillips head
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">Phillips screw drive</a> and its corresponding screw head is one of the most recognizable types of screw heads that is commonly used in construction. This type of screw head was named after its inventor, a US businessman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_F._Phillips" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Henry F. Phillips">Henry F. Phillips</a>. Neither the inventor nor his invention have any relationship to the Dutch electronics manufacturing company with similar, but not exactly the same name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Philips">Philips</a>. Technically speaking, this is not a Phillips, as a Phillips screw head is rounded at the center.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Flat head
</td>
<td>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Slot" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">Slot head screws</a> are frequently erroneously referred to as flat heads (a flat head screw refers, in fact, to the shape of the screw head, regardless of the shape of the drive socket). The slot head is also commonly used in construction. Although the diagram shows the slot truncated, the slot almost always runs across the entire head of the screw (as in the case of the "uranium screw" below).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Uh oh. Maybe it's on Amazon? (star-shaped screw)
</td>
<td> Manufacturers sometimes use screws that require special screwdrivers in order to prevent the customer from opening the product. The reference to Amazon is presumably a suggestion to search <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> for the screwdriver. A number of star-shaped screw heads exist, notably the six-pointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Torx">Torx</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apple Inc.">Apple</a>'s rounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pentalobe screw">pentalobe screw</a>, although there is no popular design that uses the 5-pointed star shape depicted in the comic. Torx screws are common in automotive applications — Phillips heads are designed to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_out" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cam out">cam out</a>" at high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Torque">torque</a> to protect the screw, whereas Torx do not — and on bicycles where a higher tightening torque is needed than hex screws can support. They are also commonly used on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_brake" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Disk brake">disk brake</a> mounts and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphones" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Smartphones">smartphones</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Cursed &#8722;1 Phillips head
</td>
<td> The head of a screw can be stripped by overuse, tightening the screw too much, using the wrong size screwdriver, or other misuse. As the driving surfaces wear away, removing the screw becomes more difficult, and the added pressure needed to drive the screw usually damages it further.
<p>The addition of "cursed" and "&#8722;1" in the titles is a reference to various role playing games (e.g. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dungeons and Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a></i>), where magical "cursed" items appear frequently. This often makes the cursed equipment (in the case of armor or weapons) incredibly difficult to remove, as it will cling to the wielder. Similarly, the cursed Phillips Head screw becomes difficult to remove due to the stripped head. Alternatively, this may imply that the damage to the screw head was caused <i>because</i> the screw is "cursed" and therefore difficult to remove.
</p><p>The "&#8722;1" refers to the damage of the screw head. In role playing games, items such as weapons and armor may have an "enchantment", with a positive enchantment making the item more effective, and a negative enchantment making the item less effective. Negatively enchanted items are often also cursed, as is the case with this screw head. The "&#8722;1" does not appear to be a reference to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">Phillips bit-size number</a>, as those are always positive.
</p><p>Notably, the stripped screw bears a resemblance to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Pozidriv" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">Pozidriv head</a>, a modified version of the Phillips head designed to resist slipping and subsequent stripping. Using a Phillips head screwdriver in a Pozidriv screw is very likely to damage the screw head and cause a real Pozidriv screwdriver to no longer mate correctly.

<tr>
<td> Crap, it's a <i>rivet</i>.
</td>
<td> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rivet">rivet</a> is not a screw — it is a permanent fastener which is secured by deforming the body of the fastener. Rivets cannot be removed with a screwdriver, they must be drilled out. Some bolts also have rounded rivet-style heads, though, which need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collet" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Collet">collet</a>-style tool to grip and remove.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Phillips head ruiner <i>(actually a hex screw)</i>
</td>
<td> A reference to the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Hex_socket" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">hex socket</a> screws can, in a pinch, be removed with a Phillips screwdriver (rather than the intended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_wrench" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Allen wrench">Allen wrench</a>) but this will likely ruin the screwdriver (and damage the screw) in the process.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Uranium screw
</td>
<td> Uranium screws were <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/11/10/fat-mans-uranium/">used</a> in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.scintillators.ru/booc/criticality/reports/ref_050.pdf">construction</a> of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/769001">nuclear weapons</a> during the twentieth century. Multiple radially extending short wave-like lines around the screw head symbolize radiant energy output, although real uranium screws were most likely made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Depleted uranium">depleted uranium</a>, which is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabc.htm">40 percent less radioactive</a> than naturally-occurring raw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Uranium">uranium</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Phillip's head
</td>
<td> This is a morbidly literal interpretation of the misuse of an apostrophe in "Phillip's head". This "screw" is actually a bloody bag containing the severed head of someone named Phillip. Intentionally or otherwise, this last punchline could be described as a "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew"><span style="background: #eef;" title="Warning: TV Tropes. See comic 609.">mind screw</span></a>".
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Hex bolt (title text)
</td>
<td>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Hex" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of screw drives">hex bolt</a> has six external sides, so it could in theory be held by squeezing two screwdriver shafts together with the bolt in between. The amount of force on the two screwdriver shafts needed to turn the hex bolt will probably exceed the strength of human hands — the attempt would most likely only result in causing your hands to cramp or causing the screwdrivers to slip and cause further injury. The title text is making a play on the phrase "you can try", which normally implies something with a reasonable chance of success, but here is only pointing out "just because you <i>can</i> doesn't mean you should".

<p>I don't think that patent is the right one, it seems to describe a uranium decontamination procedure, not a screw made of uranium like in the comic. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:LeoDeQuirm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:LeoDeQuirm (page does not exist)">LeoDeQuirm</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:LeoDeQuirm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:LeoDeQuirm (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:46, 16 January 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I'm pretty sure the "uranium screw" is just a reference to the fact that the head of the screw appears to have split in two ("fissioned"), as opposed to a normal flat head screw that still has the edges connected. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Sam887&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sam887 (page does not exist)">Sam887</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam887&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sam887 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:50, 16 January 2015 (UTC)

</p><p>An actual rivet is neither a screw nor a bolt; it's a fastener that is placed and then has one end plastically deformed -- traditionally by a rivet gun, but more often in smaller sizes by some sort of press or clamp. (Pop rivets are hollow, and are deformed by pulling a cone-sheaped wedge into the open end of the hollow core.) There's no way to remove one except to destroy it (drill it out or cut one end off). The item pictured could also be the head of a carriage bolt, but that's no help if you can't get at the other end of the bolt. Randall is slightly pessemistic, though: there *are* some "security" screws and bolts that use a slightly-elliptical domed head that's hard to tell from a rivet; they can be unscrewed, but only with a matching slightly-elliptical socket. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.133.70" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.133.70">199.27.133.70</a> 06:35, 16 January 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The most awkward, I find, are star-shaped (5/6-pointer) screws with a central 'post' that requires a hole-ended screwdriver-bit of the appropriate shape to be used (may also aid in positive positioning of the tool, but not much more than normally so SFAICT it's just there to be awkward without the right tools by manufacturer-mandated professionals).  Luckily, I've <i>got</i> screwdriver-heads for just about every conceivable 'uncursed' screwhead (48 different types and sizes in one handy kit alone, not even counting socket-heads and 'cursed' screw drilling-outers).

<p>"cursed -1 &lt;something&gt;" is definitely a standard NetHack item description format, but it applies to D&amp;D too. In general, "cursed" means you cannot remove the item, and the number is describing the item's effectiveness compared to a standard (+0) version of the item. In this case, both can be appropriate: "cursed" because -as noted- you cannot remove it in the normal way. "-1" probably comes from being unable to tighten the screw far enough to fully satisfy its purpose: maybe the joint is slightly loose, or the head of the screw is left slightly protruding, so that it easily catches on other things.

</p><p>Rather than two (still) separate fissile hemispheres, that 'gap' is obviously a continuation of material around the back of a schematic cross-section of a whole sphere with a core currently missing.  I think the fissile plug will be inserted/fired at the required juncture to fill this, from the side.  Very like the device in the film The Fifth Protocol, for easy cinematic reference of the concept.  (Noting that 'gun-type' nuclear devices tend to fire the 'enclosing' larger subcritical mass, spheroidal or cylindrical <i>onto</i> the smaller and fixed 'plug' to fill the gap between it and the surrounding neutron reflector jacket.  For several very good reasons.  Thus that sphere would be shoved onto the currently missing 'core', although it makes the reflector assembly and positioning a bit more complex as well, compared with a cylindrical sleeve.) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.247" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.247">141.101.98.247</a> 13:49, 16 January 2015 (UTC)

</p><p>Isn't Philip's head a joke about his frustration with types of screws? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Halfhat" title="User:Halfhat">Halfhat</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Halfhat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Halfhat (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:34, 18 January 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>It is my opinion that "Phillip's Head" (the bloody sack) is actually a reference to "King Philip" <i>(note the spelling with only one 'L')</i>, an American Indian of the Wompanoag tribe in the latter 1600s who was the leader of an uprising against the settlers of Plymouth Colony.  He was killed in 1676 and his corpse mutilated, with the head separated from the body and the body itself dismembered.  The head was spiked and carried to Plymouth Settlement, eventually being placed on the Plymouth Colony Fort where it was left to languish for some 25 years.  The head (by now merely a jawless skull) was eventually secreted away by a colonial family that was friendly to him; they kept King Philip’s head for many generations before giving it to his descendants.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.217.161" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.217.161">108.162.217.161</a> 09:58, 18 January 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>Perhaps the five-pointed star screw and its Amazon reference refer to the fact that it looks like a review star on Amazon?  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.53.10" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.53.10">173.245.53.10</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:173.245.53.10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:173.245.53.10 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>I feel I have to question the phrase "Imperial-sized hex screws do sometimes surface, to the dissatisfaction of anyone who owns a hex driver set." As a mentor for a FIRST Robotics Team (Go 811!), we use Imperial-sized hex screws all the time. And here in the US, Imperial hex/Allen wrenches/keys are more common than their Metric counterparts. (sigh ... maybe SOMEday we'll wise up and go metric ...) --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Mr._I&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mr. I (page does not exist)">Mr. I</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Mr._I&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mr. I (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:58, 19 January 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I've just removed what I consider to be excess bloat from the explanation. I'm sure some people will disagree, but to me the descriptions of the screws were getting bogged down in excessive an unecessary details. As an example, the fact that torx screws are able to be used for higher torques really doesn't have anything to do with the comic. The long rambling sentence about french royalty being guillotined was interesting (to me at least), but didn't really come to a conclusion. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Pudder" title="User:Pudder">Pudder</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Pudder" title="User talk:Pudder">talk</a>) 17:23, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I believe 'Uranium Screw' is referring to a screw with a "half life" of sorts - these types of flathead screws (which obviously exist, just are not as common) tend to "split in half" when they fail as opposed to just stripping.  Half of the head splits off, similar to uranium decaying halfway. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.217.173" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.217.173">108.162.217.173</a> 16:58, 21 February 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>The Torx standard is primarily a 6-pointed star, but a 5-pointed star is used for smaller wire types, as noted on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx</a>. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.180" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.180">108.162.238.180</a> 16:49, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>Just my 2 cents, since a lot of commentators were writing about the types of screws they're most familiar with. Here in Brazil, at least where I live, the standard is slot and Phillips, with the latter becoming more prominent. Allen and Torx are used in more expensive products, like HDDs and cars. I've only known about Pozidrivs from Wikipedia. I can't speak for the construction area, but I suppose it doesn't change much. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/188.114.99.189" title="Special:Contributions/188.114.99.189">188.114.99.189</a> 18:45, 7 December 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I wrote too soon. I just found Pozidriv screws in a sofa's feet. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/188.114.99.189" title="Special:Contributions/188.114.99.189">188.114.99.189</a> 19:23, 10 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Uh oh. Maybe it's on Amazon? (star-shaped screw) - 5 point 'torx' is somewhat common in automotive industry as a temper proof alternative to regular 6 point torx. Some examples would be MAF sensors and old Mercedes Benz rearview mirrors
