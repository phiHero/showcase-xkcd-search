<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> is checking his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon Go">Pokémon Go</a></i> app to check on the status of a Pokémon he had previously left in a gym (to defend it against the other two teams in the game). In the gym he sees that another player named "Reelect Trump 2020" has left a frog Pokémon, which is now standing next to his. Cueball, evidently not a fan of President Trump or his supporters, finds it distasteful to be indirectly associated with someone whose political views he finds unpleasant. (Alternatively, it may simply be that Cueball doesn't want politics injected into a game that he plays for fun.)
</p><p>When he remarks on this to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a>, she observes out how strange that remark would sound if he said it to his younger self from 20 years ago. Normally when people say "imagine going back in time", they are merely constructing a hypothetical scenario to illustrate how rapidly society has changed over the years. Megan is likely pointing out that the idea of Donald Trump becoming the President of the United States (let alone coming up for re-election) would have seemed very farfetched just 20 years ago.
</p><p>However, it turns out that Cueball somehow actually does <i>have</i> the time-travel technology required to pull this off, and so he takes Megan's suggestion literally and goes back in time 20 years to do exactly what she suggested: he repeats the statement to his younger self to see what his reaction will be.
</p><p>Unfortunately, past Cueball (in the year 1999) chooses to focus on a completely different aspect of the statement: the fact that <i>Pokémon</i> - a game that past Cueball sees as a children's game - will still somehow be popular in 20 years, and that his adult self is still playing it. These observations make Cueball feel uncomfortable, as they highlight the fact that he is spending time on pursuits that his younger self sees as frivolous or childish. He gets defensive and starts to argue with his younger self.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon">Pokémon</a> is a media franchise that debuted in 1996 in Japan as both a video game and a trading card game. It was originally designed for and marketed to younger children (the tie-in cartoon series constantly emphasizes its main characters are ten years old), with a design, aesthetic and gameplay that were optimized for a younger audience. Since then, and up to 2019, there have been a total of eight generations of video games on consoles. As the franchise continued to thrive and evolve, it's gone through multiple generations, including <i>Pokémon Go</i>, an augmented reality game for smartphones. These latest versions, in particular, have become popular with (and marketed to) adults, some of whom grew up playing the earlier generations. 
</p><p>In 1999 in North America, only the first generation of Pokémon video games had been released, consisting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon Red and Blue"><i>Pokémon Blue</i> and <i>Pokémon Red</i></a> for the Nintendo Gameboy. The second generation of Pokémon video games would not even be announced in Japan until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver#Release" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pokémon Gold and Silver">November 1999</a>, and advertising for the North American release would begin in December of 1999.  A person living in 1999, who has only seen the first generation, with no official confirmation that a second generation was even being considered, and unable to predict the nostalgia market that would appear later, would quite plausibly wonder about its popularity 20 years later.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald J. Trump">Donald J. Trump</a> was the president of the United States at the time of publishing, elected in 2016. Even during his campaign, the idea of his election was considered absurd in many circles, as he had never held any kind of public office, and had no background that would lend itself to expertise in government or public policy. Prior to his election, he was primarily known as a New York real estate mogul and host of the 2003 reality television show <i>The Apprentice</i>.  While he'd been teasing the idea of a presidential run since the 1980s, and indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2000_presidential_campaign" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign">was seeking the Reform Party candidacy in 1999</a> (at the advice of then-Governor of Minnesota <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Ventura" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jesse Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a>, another actor-turned-politician), most people did not take the idea seriously, and the concept of him actually being President of the United States would have been hugely unexpected to most Americans in an earlier era.  1999 Cueball might regard the name "Reelect Trump 2020" as an ironic joke, like a campaign button for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vermin Supreme">Vermin Supreme</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sweetmeteorofdeath.com/">Sweet Meteor Of Death</a>.
</p><p>Randall released a comic about Pokémon Go less than a week after its release back in July 2016: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1705" class="mw-redirect" title="1705">1705: Pokémon Go</a>. But Pokémon in general has been a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Category:Pokémon">recurring theme</a> in xkcd long before Pokémon Go was released.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-the-frog">Pepe the Frog</a> is an internet meme that has become associated with Donald Trump after his use of it during his presidential campaign. The use of a frog Pokémon, therefore, is a callback to this internet phenomenon. 
</p><p>The Pokémon left in the gym is most likely <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Politoed_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Politoed</a>, the only official frog Pokémon released in the game at the time of publication. It comes from the tadpole series with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Poliwag_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Poliwag</a> that evolves into <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Poliwhirl_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Poliwhirl</a> which by using a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/King%27s_Rock">King's Rock</a> can be evolved to Politoed (instead of to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Poliwrath_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Poliwrath</a>). There are other frog like Pokémon in the game which are scheduled to be added to Pokémon Go, but where people who dislike Trump might have chosen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Toxicroak_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Toxicroak</a>, it seems an unlikely choice by a fan that hopes Trump is reelected!
</p><p>This comic's joke is similar to one used in the 1985 science-fiction film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a></i>, in which Doc Brown (of 1955) is shocked to learn that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> would be the President of the United States in thirty years' time, when in 1955 Reagan was a TV actor.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Digimon">Digimon</a>, as mentioned in the title text, is another media franchise which is similar to Pokémon in some ways, though it is sometimes perceived as more "cool" and "adult" oriented.  Its popularity in North America rose around 1999 with the airing of its anime series, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://geekinsider.com/digimon-vs-pokemon-retrospective-monster-marketing/">never became as popular as Pokémon</a>.
</p><p>This was the first of two time travel comics in less than a week, as the one two comics after this one, <a href="/wiki/index.php/2222:_Terminator:_Dark_Fate" title="2222: Terminator: Dark Fate">2222: Terminator: Dark Fate</a>, also had future Cueballs travel back to visit their past self.

<p>I wonder if Randall had a particular "frog pokemon" in mind? Croagunk, Toxicroak, Froakie, Frogadier, Greninja...? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.44.150" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.44.150">172.69.44.150</a> 19:58, 25 October 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The Poliwhirl family dates from Generation 1 and is the "original" frog pokémon. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.122.36" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.122.36">162.158.122.36</a> 23:59, 25 October 2019 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes so fur sure the frog Pokémon Politoed from gen 2, since the Poliwag is tadpoles. I agree that Toxicroach or Croagunk would fit better with Trump in Randall's view, but it is a reelect Trump fan, so he would most likely use a green frog that is not "ugly". Have added this to the description with link to page with picture. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 22:08, 26 October 2019 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Agree that Politoed is the most likely, but contrary to what the page says currently, croagunk and toxicroak have been in the game for a few months now. (I just had a bunch of croagunk in my area and evolved a toxicroak, which is why I had them in mind when I made my previous comment.)<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.44.150" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.44.150">172.69.44.150</a> 20:13, 28 October 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Trump was quite sufficiently (in)famous by 1999. Remember that he divorced his most famous wife, Ivana, in 1991. His various business and romantic <s>failures</s> ventures were regular tabloid fodder throughout the 90s. If you think a 1999 person would have never heard of Trump, you're obviously <s>too young to be using the internet</s> younger than I am. I think the main joke in this comic is that Cueball goes back expecting his younger self to go, "wait, re-elect WHO??", but his younger self doesn't even bat an eyelash at that part. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.175" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.175">173.245.52.175</a> 21:03, 25 October 2019 (UTC)

<p>Just as I remember reading in a 1969 textbook that Ronald Regan was going to someday be elected President if (then current) political trends that became the “southern strategy” weren’t addressed, I also remember reading at least one op-Ed piece in the late 1990’s that if the political parties didn’t clean house and get rid of undue influence from big donors that someday Donald Trump would become President.  There were people worried about Trump in 1999.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.62.129" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.62.129">162.158.62.129</a> 04:13, 26 October 2019 (UTC)

Randall's apparent unthinking Trump Derangement Syndrome (I would have imagined him too intelligent to fall for mere politics) or the fact that Explain XKCD seems to have been invaded by Goldman Sachs advertising.

<dl><dd>In all fairness, I must point out that it is <i>Cueball</i> giving an kneejerk anti-Trump reaction in this comic, not Randall himself. While Randall does often project his own views through the characters of his comic, we cannot say for certain that that is the case here. In the past he has often created characters with incorrect or strawman positions in order to make a point or to satirize them. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Hawthorn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hawthorn (page does not exist)">Hawthorn</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Hawthorn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Hawthorn (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:46, 28 October 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Hmm, It seems to me that today's Cueball's (TP) dismay with the past's Cueball's (PC) reaction isn't about Trump, it's about calling him old and questioning his continued Pokemon-ing. This seems more in line with my impression of his priorities in life. With the two of them together, they could easily lose track of the 2nd half of the original odd statement and go off on the "what are you saying about me?" tangent - which makes the "I didn't come here to be mocked!" make a little more narrative sense. PC doesn't show any interesting in the Trump aspect, merely the idea of TP's still playing and being 20 years older, seems to be worth his consideration.  I don't see it as changing the future sort of thing, don't you have to kill your grandfather or something to do that? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Afbach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Afbach (page does not exist)">Afbach</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Afbach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Afbach (page does not exist)">talk</a>)

<p>I do not see any additional adds, but some additional linebreaks in between the pages, which fit the places described by those, seeing adds. Using Chrome on a company computer... So I do not know what exactly the settings are, but generally it does not block adds.

</p><p>Last Wednesday (6 to 7 days ago), according to the time stamps on my previous comments above, I was seeing 4 or 5 ads in a rather short comment section (which went away after a few refreshes after a few comments). Now I see none. Maybe whoever turned them on saw the negative reaction and turned them back off? Or maybe they only needed a quick cash injection and turned it off after they got what they needed, LOL! <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:07, 8 November 2019 (UTC)

I'm going to stop adding this conversation to new comics for the time being, because it seems like the ads have gone. It's weird though; no admin has commented on this.

</p><p>I've got full-width ads in the discussion box, but nowhere else, which is interesting, and also FLIPPING ANNOYING! Darn it, those ads are taking up the discussion box and I hate it.

</p><p>I have spotted video advertisements on the website.  I fear this issue is only getting worse with time now.
