<p>The comic shows the rise and fall of players' strengths in two games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chess">chess</a>.  For chess, there is an overall chart, and a women's chart. 
</p><p>For basketball, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Player efficiency rating">player efficiency rating</a> (PER), the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://knickerblogger.net/a-laymans-guide-to-advanced-nba-statistics/">most commonly used player statistic</a>. Note that that player efficiency ratings and similar "aggregate scores" are the subject of much discussion in basketball due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating#Problems_with_PER" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Player efficiency rating">known deficiencies</a>.
</p><p>For chess, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elo rating">Elo rating</a>. Elo was adopted by the World Chess Federation, FIDE, in 1970, so the rating is extrapolated backwards in time (among other using <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Kenneth+Wingate+Regan">Kenneth Regan's</a> computer analysis - as written in the Chess panel) and are thus shown as dashed lines prior to 1970. Interestingly Elo ratings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating#Elo_ratings_beyond_chess" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elo rating">have been adapted to basketball</a>, but the PER is more commonly used to rank basketball players.
</p><p>The charts show the players career paths as a function of time with the rating on the y-axis. There is no <a href="#Scales_of_the_axis">scale on the y-axis</a>.
</p><p><a href="#Player_inclusion_criteria">Included</a> are mainly players that could be said to have been among the dominating players at some time in their career. If a player has been the best player over a longer time period (a seriously dominating player) then their career path will be drawn in red, the rest are in gray. There can be more than one red path at a time, but only because the dominating player has played before or after they became dominating. It seems like it has to be at least five years, as there are at least two players that have been no. 1 for four years, without being upgraded to a red curve. The only ones that have managed this with three years or less (on the chart) are those that begin the chart, and thus could have been no. 1 a few years before. This can all be seen in the <b><a href="#Data_tables">data tables</a></b> below.
</p><p>The title text mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Menchik" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vera Menchik">Vera Menchik</a> who is also the first female chess player listed at the left of the bottom panel. In January 1926 she won the first Girls' Open Championship at the Imperial Club in London, but as can be seen in the last panel she was killed near the end of World War II, 38-year-old, while still holding the title of women's world champion. She, her sister, and mother were killed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:V-1 flying bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a> attack which destroyed their home in 1944. 
</p><p>The title text mentions her specifically because of the club named after her:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Menchik#The_.22Vera_Menchik_Club.22" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Vera Menchik">The "Vera Menchik Club"</a>. When in 1929, Menchik entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_1929_chess_tournament" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament">Carlsbad</a>, Viennese master, usually a tournament only for male chess players, one of the other chess players, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Becker_(chess_player)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Albert Becker (chess player)">Albert Becker</a>, ridiculed her entry by proposing that any player whom Menchik defeated in tournament play should be granted membership into the Vera Menchik Club. In the same tournament, Becker himself became the first member of the "club", much to his ridicule. It should be noted that she did end in last place vs. his fifth place, but that must just have made the defeat even tougher to take for Albert.
</p><p>Albert was the first, but far from the last male chess player to enter the Vera Menchik Club, no less than 19 other male chess players, with wiki pages, are listed on Wikipedia, amongst them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Euwe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Max Euwe">Max Euwe</a> who went on to become World Chess Champion (1935–37). So it can for sure be said that the club accumulated a large and illustrious roster.
</p><p>One and a half year later a comic, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Magnus Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a>, was released <a href="/wiki/index.php/1628:_Magnus" title="1628: Magnus">1628: Magnus</a>. This comics also compares chess players (Magnus) to other (sporting) events. Magnus was ranked no. 1 on the chess world rank when both comics were released.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Basketball_vs_chess">Basketball vs chess</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1392:_Dominant_Players&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Basketball vs chess">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Basketball is one of the fastest sports in the world, with some of the tallest people in the world among the players. Chess, on the other hand, will by many not even be considered a sport. Although a general good condition of the body may help you think clearly, you by no means need to be an athlete to do well in chess. You do, however, expect a rather high IQ among the best performers. This is not necessary to become a great basketball player (although here it is not in the way either). Another very important difference is that basketball is a team sport, whereas chess is one of the most individual sports you can imagine.
</p><p>So why compare two so different sports? And why the <a href="#References_on_the_career_paths">funny remarks</a> for the basketball players against the more serious for the chess players? Maybe <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> wishes to make fun of basketball and the fact that several of the best of these at some time during their careers choose to be in a movie or documentary. Or that they return after they retired. The remarks for the chess players is more about who loses and wins matches.
</p><p>It could also be to show how different the players' career paths are. Basketball players peak early in their career, then have at most a decade at the top of their game (and as the best), and if they are lucky they get close to a career of two decades. Chess players can dominate for two decades, and have careers that last more than three decades. Also they often continue to improve a long time after they became no 1.
</p><p>For the reason mentioned here there are 7 red basketball players from 1950-2014, whereas there are only 5 male and 3 female red players for the two chess panels. (And then one extra each for the Chess panels from before 1950). See the <a href="#Data_tables">data tables</a> below.
</p><p>Except for women's chess between 1944 till 1957 and for chess until 1947 there are always at least two players' career paths at any given time. So at least no. 1 and no. 2 are shown. But at some point in time there can be as many as 7 basketball players, 8 chess players and 8 women chess players' career paths for a given year.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/index.php/544:_Pep_Talk" title="544: Pep Talk">544: Pep Talk</a> a group of chess players tries (and fails) to be competitive in the NBA, also because they are coached by someone with no understanding of basketball...

<p>Why is chess divided in an overall (with only one woman included) and basketball not? First of all, there is very little focus on women's basketball (as for most women's sport). This may be the same for chess, but at least here the physical strength advantage for men is no direct advantage. Thus a great woman chess player may play just as interesting chess as a man. Whereas women would typically have no chance if playing on a basketball team with men. But why are women then not represented better on the overall chess ranking? This is explained and may be another reason it is included. In the <i>Chess (women)</i> panel it says: <i>For a long time, sexism, a lack of role models, and institutional hostility largely kept women from pursuing serious chess careers. With the expansion of women's tournaments and prizes starting in the 1970s, this has begun to change</i>. So now at least one woman has shown that her skills is enough to compete with the best men. With the long careers chess players usually have, then maternity leave can destroy a woman's chance at reaching the ultimate top. This could be the case for the number one woman who now has two children.

<li>Bobby Fischer – "...Reappeared then vanished again. He had problems." This is written below a double starburst with a short line between. This is another reference to Fischer - there is no name or clear correlation, except the text that relates to the first reference.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scales_of_the_axis">Scales of the axis</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1392:_Dominant_Players&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Scales of the axis">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The <b>x-axis</b> is divided in decades from 1950 until 2010. In the Basketball section the curves begins to appear right after 1950. For both chess panels there are curves further back than 1950 (with even a reference to a player from before 1940). For all three panels the paths continue up till present day (2014).
</p><p>In all cases there is no scale on the <b>y-axis</b> with the rating, thus it is difficult to find the absolute scale. It is also difficult to compare between the two chess panels. The scale on the two chess panels are, however, the same, as can be seen by comparing the curve of Judit Polgar on each chart. This curve is exactly the same, with the same elevation between the point where her curve enters the Chess panel up to the top point. This also means that any women player whose curve rises above this entry point (around 1989) should also be visible in the Chess chart. See below for inclusion criteria.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Player_inclusion_criteria">Player inclusion criteria</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1392:_Dominant_Players&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Player inclusion criteria">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>In general not all possible players are included in these charts. For instance it is mentioned that Judit Polgar was the first woman ranked in the over all top 10. But only six players are shown on the over all chart around 2005, where she was ranked 8th. So some male players, better than her at that time, have not been included. This is a general trend for all three charts.
</p><p>From the Woman's panel below it is also clear that some of the other women would be ranked high enough to be visible on the upper chart as mentioned in the <a href="#Scales_of_the_axis">Scales</a> section above. But still only Judit is shown there. 9 out of 12 of the women that are on the chart after 1989 would be visible if included in the overall chart. However, none of them could be called dominant when comparing to the best men in the same time period. And thus they are not included. Maybe the same could be said about Judth, but then she is included for scale, and because she is so good that she can compete with, and sometimes beat, the best.
</p><p>Some NBA players (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tim Duncan">Tim Duncan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Charles Barkley">Charles Barkley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Robertson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Oscar Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chris Paul">Chris Paul</a>) have been left out of the chart in favor of players with lower career and yearly efficiency ratings.
</p><p>Similarly can be mentioned for instance the no. 1 ranked chess player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veselin_Topalov" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Veselin Topalov">Veselin Topalov</a> from Bulgaria, who was ranked first both in 20062007 and in 2008-2010 for a total of less than two years. And there are likely several others (<a href="#Where_is_Viswanathan_Anand">see below</a>).
</p><p>An example of the above for Basketball would be the 2008–2009 season which was unique in that it was the only season in which more than one player posted an efficiency ratings of over 30.0 on the Player efficiency rating (see at the bottom of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating#Reference_guide" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Player efficiency rating">this section</a> on Wikipedia). In that season three players broke this barrier: LeBron James (31.76), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> (30.46), and Chris Paul (30.04). LeBron is shown to top that season, But Dwayne is far below (thus the scale does not fit?) and Chris is not on the list at all (i.e. he was not deemed to be a dominant player).
</p><p>So is this <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall's</a> subjective list of players that he has deemed to be <i>Dominant Players</i> and not a full list of the best ranked players during the time period? Of course it is his choice which players he put into the list, but missing players (when worse has been included earlier) can be explained if the missing players never were among the most dominant player over a length of time. It is not a list of the best players of all time, or of a single season, but a chart of the dominant players over a longer time period.
</p><p>If a player only has had a very short time where their careers peaked - they should not be included. Also if there most of the time where at least two others that were more dominant than they ever where - they should not be included. To tell if this explains all the excluded players mentioned/referenced above, that would take some investigation. An investigation we can assume Randall has taken upon himself before posting this comic. This of course will still make it his subjective list.
</p><p>For basketball any given player will at least have been the 2nd best (of those included) at some (longer) period of their career. And to become selected for a red curve, they need to be the best for at least five years - the first players curve is no. 1 less than five year, but he could have been no. 1 also before 1951.
</p><p>The same is valid for the Chess players (again the first players curve is red, but stops just as it enters the panel). Only exception is Judit Polgar. She is never better than 3rd of those selected. And she was never better than 8th in the world. So her inclusion is a mentioned probably only to compare her with the men.
</p><p>For the woman chess players there are the same criteria for red, except that Sonja Graf is not red although she is the only chess player on the list for more than a decade. Maybe you need to be better than someone else to become red? There are also included several women who never reaches 2nd place on the chart. Three of these reaches 3rd place and two only 4th. One of these, Anna Muzychuk, is still on the rise, so she might be on the chart, because she could possibly become first or second if she can continue to improve. The other, Sofia Polgar, is included to show that all three Polgar sisters are chess masters.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_is_Viswanathan_Anand">Where is Viswanathan Anand</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1392:_Dominant_Players&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Where is Viswanathan Anand">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>None of the above can explain why former World Champion Chess Grandmaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Viswanathan Anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> has not been included in the Chess Chart. Anand is one of only thirteen players in history to break the 2800 mark on the FIDE rating list and and still(as of 2020) has the eighth highest FIDE ranking at peak ever. He occupied the number one position in several rating lists between 2007 and 2011. The reason could possible be because Randall may be a huge fan of Magnus Carlsen, and thus biased against Anand - there is some evidence for this in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1287:_Puzzle" title="1287: Puzzle">1287: Puzzle</a>. In the title text of that comic it seems that Randall makes fun of Anand in a match against Magnus. The interpretation of the comic and its comment, however, appear to be a double-edged matter of debate. However, since the release of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1628:_Magnus" title="1628: Magnus">1628: Magnus</a>, named after Magnus, there can be no doubt that Randall is a fan of Magnus.
</p><p>Anand can for instance be found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessmetrics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chessmetrics">Chessmetrics</a> devised by statistician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sonas" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jeff Sonas">Jeff Sonas</a>. In the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp">graph from 1995-2005</a> of Sonas famous research from 2005, Anand becomes the best during 2004. It can, however, also be seen that Randall does not agree with Sonas - this is very clear in this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=194020SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100">graph from 1940-1960</a>. Here Mikhail Botvinnik clearly plays way better than Alexander Alekhine in 1946, where Alexander dies. This is not shown like this in the comic. Maybe the death of Alexander becomes the more interesting in the comic, if you believed he was the best at the time. Note that all nine (male) names listed in the comics chart between the lines at 1950 and 2000 are included in this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=195050SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100">graph from 1950-2000</a>. In this chart it is clear that Bobby Fischer was by far the best in the years before he disappeared. However, he was caught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Karpov" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Anatoly Karpov">Anatoly Karpov</a> just before which is not shown in the comic. On the other hand, he seems to have reached a significant higher rating than Kasparov ever did, which is also not the case in the comic.

<dd>[Below this heading there are three panels with charts showing different players career paths - that is their rating a function of the year. Most of the paths are grey, but some are red (there will be a note for these). Some parts of several paths are dashed. Somewhere on each path the players name will be written curving along so it follows the path. Several places an event or some information is noted and points to a given time on the path. If it is not clear where it belongs an arrow will point to the correct place. Each chart has a heading and for the two last charts there is an explanation. There is no scale on the y-axis (rating) but the x-axis (time) has the years given in ten years interval. A thin line indicates these decades. The years are all written at the top, except the first for the first chart, which is written below, and this year is missing in the bottom chart.]</dd>

<ul><li>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/4/45/20140710201235!dominant_players.png">original comic</a> said about Kira Zvorykina "Continued playing in tournaments into the 20th century". The 20th century is the 1900s in which Zvorkina was born (on September 29, 1919 according to Wikipedia). Randall has corrected the notation to say "into the 21st century."</li>
<li>The names of three NBA players have been misspelled: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Johnston" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Neil Johnston">Neil Johnston</a> (misspelled as "Neal"), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (missing hyphen), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Erving" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Julius Erving">Julius Erving</a> (misspelled "Irving".)</li>
<li>The order of the names of an Indian chess playing woman has been given in the native version in the comic, where the western version would use the reverse as here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpy_Koneru" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Humpy Koneru">Humpy Koneru</a>.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Data_tables">Data tables</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1392:_Dominant_Players&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Data tables">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<ul><li>Below are three sortable tables, with the original order as the players name appear in the transcript i.e. chronological.</li>
<li>One of the objectives of the tables is to make it clear what is the criteria for a player obtaining a red path. Thus there is an x for red path and an x for being no. 1 on the charts. Also the number if years a player has been no. 1 is given.</li>
<li>All data in these tables are taken from the comic - except the names - they are taken from Wikipedia. See trivia items above.</li>
<li>The total years as no. 1 is not the same in each table, as those players entering the panels from outside (before 1942), do not get a length of time as being no. 1. For basketball the chart first begins in 1951 (together with the rating system?)
<ul><li>Since the years as no. 1 has been roughly estimated from the charts (with a ruler) the sum total can also not be expected to fit with the first entry and today (and they miss with at least a couple of years each), as all years have been rounded to the nearest whole year.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the comments column, there is references to the relevant section in the explanation if there are any notes/references in the comic for the player. Also references are made to the trivia section for errors etc. Other comments are for special observations regarding said player.
<ul><li>So use the comments if you have any interesting but short note to add for a given player.</li>
<li>In case of longer info: If they are regarding the table, write them in bullets below the relevant table (and make a note on the players comments), or add it to the trivia section above.</li>
<li>More general things or info on <a href="#Player_inclusion_criteria">players missing from the comic</a> should be added to the explanation above.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Dashed lines are apparently for the period before ELO ratings existed, taking 1965 as a start point (midway between the point in time when ELO rating was adopted by USCF and FIDE, respectively.

<dl><dd> As Judith Polgar is present in the first chart, it appears to be an overall, not specifically a men's chart.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jkrstrt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jkrstrt (page does not exist)">Jkrstrt</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jkrstrt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jkrstrt (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:37, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd> My impression is that the above is the Men's Chart but with Judit added (hence the note), because (although unsure because of the curse of unlabelled axes) some of the other top-ranking-women-but-not-top-ranking-overall would still earn a position on the above 'graph'.</dd>

<dl><dd>No. Koneru Humpy is mentioned. He's a big Carlson fan and I think he doesn't like Anand. One of his old comics suggested that.

<p>I haven't seen any mention of this interpretation, so it might be just me, but I immediately read the juxtaposition of basketball to chess as a contrast of how skill at the top level of basketball is essentially stagnant, whereas the best chess players have been outstripping their predecessors for decades.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.157" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.157">173.245.52.157</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:173.245.52.157&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:173.245.52.157 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

</p><p>A couple points;
1) I would interpret the Basketball vs. Chess dichotomy as a slam against basketball, with the (largely) serious comments about chess vs. pointing out movies on BB.  There are a jillion things he could have chosen to comment on - why highlight the embarassing career moves of BB players?
(2) The rating system for BB has an (essentially) static upper limit, whereas these chess rating systems have larger upper bounds as the player pool grows, so comparisons of upper bounds are unfair.  That may be part of the point, or a dishonest comparison.  Not sure of Randall's motivations.   (not that I like BB anyways...)
(3) No comparison to women's BB is made - so this further inclines me to think that there are two separate agendas here: (i) physical BB vs. mental chess and (ii) women's rights in chess.  An honest comparison would include women's BB as well.
(4) The vertical axis on the graphs do not start at zero, so the scaling could be correct... just somewhat deceiving by violating fundmental rules of creating graphs (no labels, inconsistent scales and they have non-zero bases).
(5) Red lines are *generally* the top person at some point in their career for more than 5(?) years (David Robinson seems like the tell)
</p><p>All in all, rather disappointed in the seemingly conflicting political agendas and poorly represented graphs.

<dl><dd> Chess is divided by sex at the professional level. Because of the way that Elo is calculated, this division makes it impossible to fairly display them on the same chart. Elo is based on a comparison of players to one another, and because it's not zero-sum, the level of skill described a certain Elo lowers over time. When it was new, a thousand would have been incredible, because everyone had started out low and were competing against other low-ranked players. And since the pools of opponents are different due to the professional-level sex divide, their skills cannot be compared by Elo. Plotting women onto the mens' chart would result in the women being ranked poorly, because the meaning of a certain Elo score is different. This is also why chess is gradually climbing while basketball stays at the same maximum. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.209" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.209">108.162.246.209</a> 12:54, 18 July 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>That's incorrect, Chess is not officially divided by sex at the professional level.  There are "Open" tournaments, in which either gender is welcome to compete, and "Women's" events, in which only women are allowed to compete.  Second, elo is not gender specific.  It is merely a comparison of playing strength/a prediction of the likelihood player A defeats player B, and there is no "men's" elo and "women's" elo.  Nor are the "pools of opponents different."  At any broadly open tournament in the world, like the U.S. Open, men and women play each other.  You might be mistaken by looking only at ultra high-tier tournaments, which are almost exclusively men, as many of them are by invite or placement only.  But again, that is because men dominate the upper level of competition, not because women are not allowed in; it's just a plain statement of fact that a top women's player like Hou Yifan would be steamrolled at a tournament like Wijk An See.  When Judit was an active player, she regularly competed in these tournaments because her skill level was on or near par with these players. </dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>In short, your comment is just wrong.  The meaning of an Elo score is not different for each sex.  There is no official segregation at the professional level; there is just a nuanced appreciation that the major female players are not yet at the level of the major male players.  That is why very small (in terms of number of players) round robin tournaments like Wijk An See have a women's section and an open section-without a women's section, there would be no women in the tournament at all.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.210" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.210">108.162.216.210</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.216.210&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.216.210 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Any way to find out which NBA and ABA Randall is referring to? NBA could be National Basketball Association or Nepal Basketball Association.

<dl><dd> ABA is near certainly the American Basketball Association, since the two leagues merged in 1976 and four current NBA teams came from the ABA. I find it difficult to imagine that we have the stats necessary to determine a number 1 player statistically from other leagues. Additionally, Julius Irving and Moses Malone are listed on the chart -- they were both playing for ABA teams prior to the merger. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.55" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.55">173.245.54.55</a> 17:57, 18 February 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd> For completeness, a Google search reveals no such entity as the "Nepal Basketball Association" in existence (there is a Nepal Basketball League, but it was founded in 2018); the professional basketball league in Australia did not become known as the Australia Basketball Association until 1999; the entity currently known as the ABA League was founded in 2001. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.78.124" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.78.124">162.158.78.124</a> 18:04, 18 February 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
