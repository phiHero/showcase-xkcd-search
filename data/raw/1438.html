<p>This comic presents a joke: a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> is at Mission Control, but is failing to help a damaged spacecraft, and is, in fact, being rather unhelpful and completely ignoring them. This is contrary to how one would expect mission control to behave in the event of an explosion.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>Alternatively, this could be some type of commentary:
</p>
<ul><li>Outsourcing of call centers reducing quality.</li>
<li>Call centers ignoring critical calls.</li>
<li>Tech savvy people mocking those with limited technological comprehension.</li>
<li>NASA's quality issues in recent decades, potentially due to funding cuts and direction shift.</li>
<li>Someone named "Houston" at a call center picking the phone up.</li></ul>
<p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a>'s way to the Moon, during a routine stirring of one of the oxygen tanks, an explosion occurred that damaged the craft. Frantic efforts by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center">mission control</a> center located in Houston resulted in the safe return of all astronauts.
</p><p>A similar situation is depicted in this strip including the design of the spacecraft, the nature of the problem, and the famous misquote "Houston, we have a problem". The modern type of monitor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Liquid-crystal display">flat panel LCD</a>) in front of which Cueball sits suggests that the author is describing a more modern scenario. This time there is much less help from mission control. Upon receiving the message from the spacecraft, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> seems fairly indifferent. Instead of attempting to resolve the issue, he mocks the crew for not knowing how to stir and hangs up in favor of taking a call.
</p><p>In the title text we learn that the call was from Cueball's mother, which should be far less important than helping the crew return safely. He also tells her that he's doing "nothing important"—further driving home how little he cares about them.
</p>

<p>NASA mission <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a> was intended to be the third manned landing on the moon. Immediately following the explosion, astronaut Jack Swigert calmly reported—and shortly later repeated by James A. Lovell—to mission control: "Houston, we've had a problem"—a notable understatement which was famously misquoted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13_(film)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apollo 13 (film)">1995 film adaptation of the mission</a> as "Houston, we have a problem".
</p><p>Mission control worked diligently and tirelessly to solve numerous problems such as:
</p>
<ul><li> If and how to adjust the spacecraft's trajectory.</li>
<li> How to have the astronauts jury-rig CO<sub>2</sub> removal equipment intended for the command module to work with the lunar module (to which the astronauts had evacuated) using the equipment on board.</li>
<li> How to power the equipment back up within strict limitations.</li></ul>

<p>A commentary on the nature of outsourced helpdesks, perhaps?  Although, IME, the problems are more due to 'sticking to a script' (which would have given an entirely different exchange) rather than an unknowledgable and casually uninterested 'service'-person. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.247" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.247">141.101.98.247</a> 05:15, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I think this is the idea behind the comic too. Kind of like a "What if it had happened today?" It sure sounds like the kind of hotline support we get today. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Deantwo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deantwo (page does not exist)">Deantwo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Deantwo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Deantwo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:29, 24 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree. This is definitely comparison between the original mission control center and current outsourced helpdesk centers. Although it would be interesting to know what specific incident caused Randal to comment on it. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 12:28, 24 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I'm going to throw in the idea that this might be a reference to the "Facebook generation", hard to know what the reference is, but a few weeks ago in Australia, or national curriculum organization published a new curriculum program for year 9/10 students, teaching them how to be functional in the work place, respect for the workplace, other employees, bosses, work time, etc... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.217" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.217">108.162.250.217</a> 14:32, 27 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>What is going on is this strip? Usually it's a reference to something or a commentary, but I don't get it at all. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Cheeselover724&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cheeselover724 (page does not exist)">Cheeselover724</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Cheeselover724" title="User talk:Cheeselover724">talk</a>) 05:32, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>I think I figured out enough of it to remove the "incomplete" tag.

</p><p>Also, I took it to refer to people being distracted on the phone in general (hence the title text) or generally not taking their jobs serious.

<p>There are a LOT of anachronisms, or things that don't match the way things were back in the 1960's, not just the flat screens. (And I do still remember the sixties, despite "if you can remember the sixties, you wern't really there" - a reference to the drug scene.) We didn't say "cool" or "you suck at doing that" back then, and it's very unlikely that communications with the mission and a simple telephone call would be selectable from the same headset, and the michrophones on headsets were larger and probably had dangling wires back then. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:RenniePet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RenniePet (page does not exist)">RenniePet</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:RenniePet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:RenniePet (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:22, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>It could be a commentary on privatizing space travel by NASA (among others to Boeing). Would explain, why Cueball knows it's a "airplane or whatever".--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.49.29" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.49.29">173.245.49.29</a> 13:36, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>I understand it's a reference, but is this supposed to actually be the Apollo 13? I understood it was just another mission happening today. I find the anachronism explanation nonsensical. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.212.211" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.212.211">108.162.212.211</a> 13:57, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>"At first glance, this comic appears to be an "alternate reality" view at what could happen today, given that most people in the XXI century seem to suffer ADD." I don't think that we can assume this at all.

<dl><dd>Yeah.  I think it's far more clear that Randall's commenting on unhelpful tech support than anyon'es short attention span.

<p>Am i the only one interpreting Cueball as a script kiddie with too much spare time who somehow managed to hijack the communication line between Apollo 13 and Houston? The alt text is consistent with the basement dweller stereotype.

<p>Nasa just uploaded several audio recordings of their missions on soundcloud (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://soundcloud.com/nasa">https://soundcloud.com/nasa</a>).

<p>I don't get the context here. Is this supposed to be a biting satire on how the new generation sucks at social tact with their cell phones? How is a guy at NASA mission control being an asshat supposed to be funny or thought-provoking? Even the helpdesk angle doesn't really make sense, as inept as they can be I've never had one outright antagonize me like this guy does.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.128.114" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.128.114">‎199.27.128.114</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:199.27.128.114&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:199.27.128.114 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>I found the comic to be more of a reference to that of a "friend" who does not care what your problems are and doesn't wish to help you solve them- like if you had lost homework or forgotten to do a project and called your friend at the last minute, he would mock you for your incompetence and blow you off. I found the comic to be a little pedanticism, as if what if mission control was filled with the "friends." I had no thought as to tech support... Maybe because all my tech support has been helpful.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.27" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.27">108.162.216.27</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.216.27&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.216.27 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>The problem in call centers is that the businesses that run them cannot afford to train all incoming staff in the entirity of the technical
knowledge required to actually be able to diagnose problems, so they design a "script" to be followed so that the staff can determine the problem and
explain the solution.  However, for those that do this job day in and day out and constantly have people calling with the "Same problems, over and over",
they get really good at predicting when someone's situation is leading to a certain forgone conclusion in the script, and may develop a disdain for the
callers due to the problem being "so painfully obvious how to fix, why does this person need to call me to fix that?  Why don't they know how to do it
themselves?"  Which is caused by the fallacy of treating the entire job as being one experience with a single userbase rather than individual experiences
with individual users.  For those that are less versed in the technical knowledge that are just trying to do their jobs, their reaction when receiving
this attitude tends towards "Why are you being so difficult?  I called you for help!"
</p><p>The largest problem created by this mindset is that people start seeing everyone else as idiots because they seem like they don't know what they're doing
to the individual, but that's only caused by the fact that they are overexposed to their overly simplistic jobs and thus believe everyone else ought to
know how to do what they are doing too - the fallacy here is coming from the fact that all the other individuals have their own specialized jobs -
individuals don't get the opportunity to experience anything outside their own job experience very often because their jobs consume so much of their
personal lives.  Because of these overly simplified jobs individuals throughout the populace all have a sort of learned helplessness - they are all very
good at one or two things, but rubbish at most everything else.  And since the governments need good consumers to drive the money wheels of the economy,
they pacify the intellectual needs of the people with entertainment.  Those that still disobey the rules and are not creating enough money and jobs for
the economy are jailed.  Those that are creating enough money and jobs for the economy then hire lawyers and lobbiests to change the laws to protect
their interests.
</p><p>Of course there is also the issue that since those who are applying for the position aren't always required to have some background training in the field
they are supporting, the applicant may have no interest in it whatsoever other than as a paycheck - these folks tend to be the ones that stick closest to
the script, because without the script they themselves are lost - these type of personnel can and have been replaced by automated prompts by some
companies.  By allowing the customer to step themselves through the script, you no longer need an employee on the line to do that with the customer.
</p><p>The consequence of leaving someone like this to answer incoming requests is that they generally feel their life is more important than the client calling
in because they have no idea what they are actually doing other than following a script, and generally don't care, "as long as I get my 40 hours in" , or
however long their work week is set to.  They see the position as a prison they are submitting to so they can get the money to do what they want/need to
in their time off - A job rather than a career.  This mindset can be seen all over the employment base of countries that have changed most working
environments into assembly line like jobs where each worker knows only one or two steps of the overall process, but almost no one knows the entire
process - because if the workers know the entire process, they could easily quit their low paying jobs and start their own business making the same
product but cheaper because they would not have all of the administrative overhead.
</p><p>So overall I'd say the comic is a social commentary combined with a play on the famous events of Appolo 13.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.158" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.158">108.162.238.158</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.238.158&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.238.158 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dt>Wrong number</dt></dl>
<p>Maybe the call has just somehow been routed to the wrong number? If Cueball were staffing some other type of helpline or call centre, his detachment and lack of understanding would probably be a natural everyday response to people who ring up with problems that aren't in his  field. The line about 'your airplane or whatever' suggests he's not NASA at all. 
</p><p>Or maybe he's staffing one of those call forwarding services, and the problem is that the astronauts forgot to say 'Could I speak to NASA, please'. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.176" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.176">141.101.98.176</a> 08:35, 26 October 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Houston is more than just mission control. If Apollo 13 is calling "Houston", they get Cueball in some Houston-based call centre. I think this, with your conclusion, explains the strip well - except the anachronism, and what's a little anachronism among friends.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.9" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.9">141.101.99.9</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.99.9&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.99.9 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small></dd></dl>
<p><b>The Time Traveler's Radio</b>
Wow. I interpreted this very differently from others. Cueball is working at a modern company that allows him to access all communication from all times. His initial "Cool" was him getting the system to intercept a radio message from the past that he could then interact with in real-time. He trolled Apollo 13 from (thier) future.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.191" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.191">108.162.216.191</a> 18:51, 27 October 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>The dialogue looks like a gamer talking to a fellow gamer.  I think that either cueball is showing his experience with gaming, presumably because of a "wrong number" or a game which cleverly connects you to NASA.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.27.133.30" title="Special:Contributions/199.27.133.30">199.27.133.30</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:199.27.133.30&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:199.27.133.30 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>I view this as an amateur using a HAM radio, such as the one in Gravity, who is either trying to troll or not believing that it was actually the crew of Apollo 13.

I may be wrong, but isn't Houston on the gulf coast? the speech bubble in the 4th panel seems to come more from the north-western part of the US, especially with the 4 smaller strokes next to the place where the speech bubble originates, it seems to indicate coming from the "edge" of the visible globe.
