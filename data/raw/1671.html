<p>When fixing/improving an existing computer program, programmers sometimes need to read, understand, and improve old (and usually bad) code. The older a piece of code is, the less it tends to conform to modern programming practices, and the more likely it is to be "arcane bullshit" from the perspective of a 21st Century programmer.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> seems to feel that willingness to deal with "arcane bullshit" is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_22" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Catch 22">Catch 22</a>" that prevents 80s arcane bullshit from being fixed. Someone completely unwilling to deal with arcane bullshit would lack the patience to learn how to program. Someone extremely willing to wade through an 80s programmer's arcane bullshit is likely to "<a href="/wiki/index.php/356:_Nerd_Sniping" title="356: Nerd Sniping">nerd snipe</a>" themselves into fiddling with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kernel (operating system)">kernels</a> (which are inherently arcane bullshit) instead of making useful code. Cueball is in the middle of the scale: smart and patient enough to make the 80s bullshit worse, but not smart and patient enough to know how to fix it.
</p><p>This comic could be a reference to changes in programming methodologies. As the first computer programs were written in the 40's and 50's they were prone to becoming "spaghetti code", where the flow of execution would jump from one part of the program to another using the JUMP which gives no state information. While this method of programming can work very quickly, it makes it difficult to predict program flow and can create interdependencies that are not obvious. In the BASIC language JUMP was called GOTO and the courses for new programmers argued that using GOTO in all but trivial cases was a very bad idea. On the other hand, old programmers argued that calculated GOTO was a sexy way of programming.
</p><p>To combat the problem computer scientists have relied on increasing the levels of abstraction and encapsulation, by developing structured programming, procedural programming, and OOP (object oriented programming).
</p><p>In structured programming you break your program into well defined blocks of code with specified entry and exit points. Using the stack (a portion of memory dedicated to storing information / program state) it is possible to call a block of code and then have that block of code return control to the point that called it after it has done what was requested.
</p><p>Very quickly it was decided to mark these blocks of code as functions or procedures, making it a lot easier to know how to call the blocks and edit them. Languages that made this a focus include Pascal, Modula, and C.
</p><p>Structured and procedural programming were well entrenched in the 80's. Most systems programming was done in mid- or low-level languages, which to improve performance don't do much to control access to the data structures in the programs. Because they are low level the code requires many steps to do seemingly easy things like draw a box on a screen, making it hard for a non-experienced programmer to understand what is happening.
</p><p>Although the idea of OOP was around as early as the 1950's, it was not implemented in a widespread fashion until the 1990's. OOP encapsulates the data structures inside of functions, so rather than manipulate the variable directly you call the data structure and tell it to do something. This additional level of abstraction can make it a lot easier to work on varied data. It also can protect the program data from unexpected changes by other sections of the program.
</p><p>Because code in the 80's was typically done at a much lower level, it can be hard for programmers used to having the language and libraries do more work for them. It also meant that programmers would often hard code expectations into their source code such as the number of files that can be opened at once, or size of the operating system disk buffers, rather than make them configurable while the program is running, or even while it was being loaded. This means if you need the program to handle a larger file, you might need to recompile it after finding and changing all the places in the code that assume the smaller max file size.
</p><p>As such, few people are willing to try to surpass the massive barrier to learning. This group is on the left. To the right are people who have gotten so used to the tools and conventions of the 80's that they spend all of their time adjusting and recompiling the kernel of their computers to match their current needs, instead of actually creating new programs.
</p><p>In the center is Cueball, presumably representing Randall, who has learned enough to try and fix code, but not enough for his fixes to actually work.
</p><p>As programs age, they often lose support from the initial project head and die out, no longer supported on new computers. So, as the title text says, learning more coding from the '90s and after is necessary for also breaking everyone else's computers.
</p><p>This could also be a comment on hacking and the advent of the internet and the technologies behind that (TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, PHP...) being 90s/2000s. Computers in the 80s were typically stand alone so what you are learning can only be applied to your machine. To break everyone else's you need to understand networking.
</p><p>The title text might be a reference to various recently discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_vulnerabilities" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Security vulnerabilities">security vulnerabilities</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Open-source software">open-source software</a>. In some cases, underskilled programmers have provided flawed code for critical infrastructure with very little review, resulting in global computer security disasters. Randall described some of these in <a href="/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes" title="424: Security Holes">424: Security Holes</a> (2008), <a href="/wiki/index.php/1353:_Heartbleed" title="1353: Heartbleed">1353: Heartbleed</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1354:_Heartbleed_Explanation" title="1354: Heartbleed Explanation">1354: Heartbleed Explanation</a> (2014).

<p>I was obsessively refreshing XKCD and the new comic popped up. Then I did the same on ExplainXKCD to make an explanation.

</p><p>Developing a kernel is not the same as compiling a kernel.  You would, for example, rebuild a Linux kernel after you've added a module, or changed some parameters.  Also, the purpose of object-oriented programming is not to solve the problem of spaghetti code. (That problem was solved by structured programming.) It's to enforce principles of abstraction, information hiding and modularity.

I think this comic refers to keeping or fixing 30 over year old programs and their "bs" factor. At which the most extreme will be something like gentoo where you have to compile everything first before doing anything productive. (Sorry gentoo users didnt meant to start a flame war)  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/103.31.5.240" title="Special:Contributions/103.31.5.240">103.31.5.240</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:103.31.5.240&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:103.31.5.240 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd>While installing applications on gentoo takes longer because it's being compiled, it's the time of the COMPUTER. You can do something else while it's compiling. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 14:16, 23 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'm afraid the explanation misses the point completely ... Rather than excursion to programming techniques and languages, the sociology behind that should be focused on. Programmers were considered mages (hence "arcane", or do I get the meaning of it wrong, not being native speaker?), and don't forget also that 80's were the time when the GNU project started. The title text then may refer to changing standards in (released) software quality - I remember my ZX Spectrum crashing because of overheating, but not because of software problems. And its system was written in assembler that is kinda badmouthed by the current version of the explanation, in favour of sophisticated languages. Then, with DOS, a problem emerged from time to time, but not a big deal. Then, with Windows 95, the system crashed daily ... Nowadays, programmers just throw their bullshit code on users, and break "everyone else's computer", also thanks to Internet etc. It has very little to do with programming language choice and jumps/gotos. - <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.95.123" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.95.123">141.101.95.123</a> 06:58, 23 April 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Agree, the "breaking everyone else's computer" is definitely about low code quality. It's true than programming with "goto" is harder, but maybe that was the reason only people who known how to program was doing it. Nowadays, everyone thinks he can program, but based on number of bugs it's obviously not true. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 14:16, 23 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The current explanation completely misses the point and honestly should be taken down -- no offense to the original writer. Arcane BS here means "wizard-like stuff" in the sense of what programmers do which is different from what users would do. Where regular users just buy a computer and never open it, the arcane programmer might just actually open the computer and start swapping parts in and out, with or without a precise grasp on what s/he's doing. Same goes on the software part where a user might just run Windows in the 80s since it comes off-the-shelf and one never modifies it, whereas the arcane programmer might go through the effort of installing a UNIX-like system such as Minix and recompile the kernel to adjust parameters, add new modules, all of which involve complicated command lines that look like insane arcane magic to normal users. This is what is called "hacking" in the sense of the original meaning of the work "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">hacker</a>" as you can find in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/">The Jargon File</a> and that work "hacking" really meant tinkering -- the word "cracker" was coined after misuse of the former by the media. 
</p><p>It was tinkering for the sole purpose of tinkering, which is why the comics says this accomplishes nothing. It is however an excellent way to learn how computers really work, something, again, that normal end-users don't care for, thus the "arcane" aspect.
</p><p>Also note that in the 80's there was no Linux (the project started in 1991) and no GNU (the project started in the mid 80s with the manifesto but GNU had no kernel at first till it got combined with Linux to form the now-ubiquitous GNU/Linux.)
</p><p>The tag line is easily explained: nowaday hacking (tinkering) on Linux is a common thing; the arcane hacking happens at the secops level. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">Ralfoide</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:02, 23 April 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>The bullshit is a reference to the whole stack of all software. Back in the 1980's, it was still possible for completely new software architectures to be started. GNU, NT, BSD, X-Windows, NeXTSTEP, C++, all started in the 1980's, all still dominant in some way. And it is all bullshit. Slow, insecure, badly architected, and we can't fix it without breaking everything. Heck, Windows 10 is still releasing security updates for kernel vulnerabilities in its font renderer, and Linux is bloating from its multitude of new features and its No Breaking Applications rule. X-Windows has a whole lot of vestigial functionality that nobody uses anymore, and lacks functionality that its own maintainers want to use, but its successor Wayland is taking a long time to come into use.
</p><p>BeOS showed what you could do for performance if you ignored backwards compatibility with backwards architectures, but it was too little, too late, and not designed for a networked world. Also, BeOS and its poorly funded open-source imitator Haiku are written in C++, and not C++14, at that.
</p><p>Which brings me to the programming languages. C++ is deliberately obtuse so it can be compatible with programs written for previous versions of C++, even those written as if C++ were C with classes. C is known for having no type safety, no memory safety, no thread safety; so C++ also lacks those unless somebody imposes strict discipline on the programmer. Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, were all written as alternatives, rejecting some aspect of C++, but they all use the same ideas of modularity and execution as C++, and they are all implemented in some combination of C, C++, and assembly(!). To be fair, though, until a major organization made it a priority (Mozilla Rust or Google Go), there just has been no high-performance alternative to C++.
</p><p>Since we all have limited time and money to deal with bullshit, we just keep using it. Decade <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.69" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.69">162.158.255.69</a> 21:46, 23 April 2016 (UTC)

So, as someone who's taken like one course on Python ever, I'd like to offer my perspective on what I think your average "dumb person" wants to know. It's not the details of how programming in the 40's worked - all that does is reinforce the fact that it's "Arcane Bullshit", which is pretty obvious because every language is pretty close to arcane bullshit. It's more about why it's funny (or possible) to get break more things with a better understanding of code. The current explanation provides about two sentences on that - which helps ("okay, so you wouldn't even try if you're not familiar"), but I still feel like I'm missing something. Is it a programmer trope that people try to fix things and blow things up (like in XKCD 349)? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.163" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.163">162.158.255.163</a> 18:27, 24 April 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Not REALLY, no. It's more that anyone who has programmed more than a little can quickly see how long and complex programs can get, especially if it was good enough and functional enough to still be around 30 years later to be getting such an update. Then, looking through the code like this, unless you programmed it in the first place, you likely would have to learn both the language AND this particular code at the same time. It's a monumental task that even an experienced and talented programmer could easily miss something (or get something wrong), at which point Murphy's Law takes over and makes sure the mistake turns out to be a doozy.&#160;:) Sometimes I've looked at programs i wrote myself 25 years ago, and it looks completely foreign to me, even though I wrote it myself, alone! - Niceguy1 <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.218.47" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.218.47">108.162.218.47</a> 03:58, 27 April 2016 (UTC) I finally signed up!

<p>As a bullshit programmer (55 years, FORTRAN) who loathes Java with a vengeance I'd like to point out that OOP merely relocated the bullshit to the classes interplay. Any program that doesn't have to navigate a rocket to the moon or suchlike I could write in FORTRAN with 10% of code and time.
