<p>In the US, people in various parts of the country refer to carbonated beverages by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_soft_drinks_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Names for soft drinks in the United States">different names</a> such as "soda", "pop", "coke", and others. Generally, the West Coast and Northeast say "soda", the South says "coke" and the rest of the country says "pop".
</p><p>There are various maps of where these different names are used, including <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://popvssoda.com/">popvssoda.com</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://laughingsquid.com/soda-pop-or-coke-maps-of-regional-dialect-variation-in-the-united-states/">this map on Laughing Squid</a>. Such maps were trending and popular in 2013.
</p><p>xkcd's map is a satire of those maps – these regional terms are fake. Not only are there far more terms than are actually used by Americans, many are terms for other beverages (mead), unrelated liquids (quicksilver), or trademarked beverage names less popular than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca_Cola" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Coca Cola">Coke</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca_Cola" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Coca Cola">Coca Cola</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mountain Dew">Code Red</a>) – and in one case, something that's not even tangible (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cryptocurrency">"Crypto"</a>).

<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanta" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fanta">Fanta</a>
</td>
<td>Name of a carbonated beverage line, manufactured by Coca-Cola.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Söde
</td>
<td>Presumably pronounced "soda" but spelled oddly (might be reference to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i> subtitles - "Wi nøt trei a høliday in Sweden this yër?").

<td>True Water
</td>
<td>Possibly a reference to Tru Blood, a fictional artificial blood substitute for vampires in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Southern_Vampire_Mysteries" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Southern Vampire Mysteries">The Southern Vampire Mysteries</a></i> book series by Charlaine Harris, and the television series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:True Blood">True Blood</a></i>. Also could be a reference to "purified" mineral waters such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaceau_Smartwater" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Glaceau Smartwater">Smartwater</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Crypto
</td>
<td>Popularized as a slang term in the late '80s and early '90s to refer to anything involving the act of encryption/decryption through the application of ciphers, a practice which has become practically ubiquitous in the digital age. Given the highlighted region is the Silicon Valley, this is almost certainly a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cryptography">cryptography</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>. None of these concepts are liquid and therefore not drinkable. Possibly a joke that the residents of Silicon Valley are actually computers that "drink" crypto (i.e. data). Might also reference the fact that it creates bubbles.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Yum
</td>
<td>Refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Yum! Brands">Yum! Brands</a>, parent company of several fast food restaurants, which was spun off from PepsiCo, maker of a carbonated beverage, in 1997, and has a lifetime contract to serve their beverages.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sparkle Fluid
</td>
<td>Roughly analogously to how "sparkling wine" and "sparkling cider" are carbonated varieties of wine and cider, "sparkling fluid" or "sparkle fluid" would presumably be any carbonated fluid
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>King Cola
</td>
<td>Name of a carbonated beverage.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pepsi">Pepsi</a>

<tr>
<td>Ichor
</td>
<td>Several definitions: blood of a god, or demon, or, in some dialects, any insect; or watery discharge from a wound.  None of them carbonated.  None of them recommended as a drinkable beverage.  (Well, not by someone with your best interests at heart.)<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>You-Know-What
</td>
<td>A phrase typically employed when a more specific term is considered <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope"><span style="background: #eef;" title="Warning: TV Tropes. See comic 609.">unspeakable or taboo</span></a>. Possibly a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and You-Know-Who (Voldemort).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_(drink)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tab (drink)">Tab</a>
</td>
<td>Name of a carbonated beverage, manufactured by Coca-Cola.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Spicewater
</td>
<td>Thought to be a reference to the spice in "Dune."
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Softie
</td>
<td>Short for soft drink. On the map, it looks like the region for Softie is being punched by the region labeled Punch.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Ohio Tea
</td>
<td>The area in question covers much of Arizona, the namesake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Beverage_Company" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arizona Beverage Company">Arizona Iced Tea</a>, itself a non-carbonated beverage. This implies that residents of Arizona view carbonated beverages as something that comes from Ohio, and thus they place Ohio's name before the word "Tea" to indicate its carbonated state.
<p>Could also refer to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/0_XAPku7SgE?t=30">"...bubbling crude. Oil that is, black gold, <b>Texas tea</b>.</a>
</p>
</td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Melt
</td>
<td>Usually used to describe a kind of sandwich where cheese is melted in the center, usually on a griddle. Possibly a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt_drink" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Malt drink">malt drink</a>. Or maybe just a way to say "no, the *melted* ice".
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fizz Ooze
</td>
<td>Fizz is the sound made when opening a sealed carbonated beverage. Ooze means a slow trickle out of a liquid.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(drink)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Punch (drink)">Punch</a>
</td>
<td>A beverage typically found in the juice aisle.  Only sometimes carbonated.  It's also a pun on the word punch, meaning to hit something, and on the map it looks like the region for Punch is literally punching the region for Softie.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fun Wine
</td>
<td>Implies that normal wine is not "fun". Might be an allusion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerwine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cheerwine">Cheerwine</a>, a carbonated beverage from the Southeast.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Diet
</td>
<td>Sometimes refers to a carbonated beverage.  A common request in restaurants, as they often only have a single "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_drink" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Diet drink">diet soda</a>" option for customers to pick.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Refill">Refill</a>
</td>
<td>A subsequent glass of whatever you drank previously.  Works for any drinkable liquid.  Some restaurants do not require extra payment for one.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Tickle Juice
</td>
<td>Name of a Boston-based jazz band. Perhaps a slang term for alcohol, as it "tickles" the tastebuds.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bubble Honey
</td>
<td> A honey-based drink with bubbles?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sugar Oil
</td>
<td>Some sodas do contain oils such as palm oil. The areas of Oklahoma and north Texas that are shaded produce a significant amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Petroleum">crude oil</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The Wet Drink
</td>
<td>Technically true of all beverages, unless one is attempting to drink sand (or anhydrous fluids - of which the least harmful may be clarified butter). It may also refer to the fact that many advertisements for carbonated beverages attempt to make the product look more appetizing by photographing or filming a beverage container covered with water droplets.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mountain Dew">Code Red</a>
</td>
<td>Name of a carbonated beverage. The cherry flavored version of Mountain Dew.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mead">Mead</a>
</td>
<td>An alcoholic beverage.  Traditionally not carbonated.  Often associated with Vikings, and these areas did have many Scandinavian immigrants.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Canadian Ale
</td>
<td>Probably a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Dry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Canada Dry">Canada Dry</a> brand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Ale" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ginger Ale">Ginger Ale</a>, a non-alcoholic carbonated beverage.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Aether
</td>
<td>In antiquity, "Aether" was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Aether (classical element)">a hypothetical liquid</a> believed to carry light waves, before electromagnetism was better understood, and also used as a term to refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(mythology)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Aether (mythology)">the sky or heavens</a>; "Aether" could refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethyl_ether" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Diethyl ether">diethyl ether</a>, a highly flammable industrial solvent, also used as an anesthetic. Neither is carbonated in its liquid form, and neither would be safe to drink as a beverage.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Carbonated Beverage
</td>
<td>Technically correct, but a bit of an awkward term due to its unnecessary length. Carbonated water with no sweeteners or other additives is labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seltzer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seltzer">seltzer</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Mouthwater
</td>
<td>A play on the term "mouth watering" to describe delicious foods and beverages. Alternatively may refer to spit, water from the mouth, or that it is a liquid one puts in their mouth.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri_Sun" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Capri Sun">Capri</a>
</td>
<td>Capri Sun is a brand of beverages flavored with fruit juice, typically sold uncarbonated in pouches.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Skim Shake
</td>
<td>A shortened name of the beverage "Skim Milkshake".
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Kid's Coffee
</td>
<td>Somewhat accurate.  Coffee is typically drunk by adults for its caffeine.  Carbonated beverages often have caffeine and are often consumed by children. Possibly a reference to the song "Kids" from the 1960 musical <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_Bye_Birdie" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bye Bye Birdie">Bye Bye Birdie</a></i>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Regular
</td>
<td>Refers to regular soda containing sugars (as opposed to diet), implying that your only choice of beverages is between regular or diet soda. In the past, "Regular" sometimes referred to gasoline containing lead, as opposed to "Unleaded" gasoline. It was not carbonated, nor safe as a beverage, and is now outlawed. Could also refer to regular coffee (in some places referring to caffeinated coffee having one milk and one sugar added, or as opposed to decaffeinated coffee), which is a beverage that is not carbonated.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_(drink)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tang (drink)">Tang</a>
</td>
<td>An orange-flavored beverage containing less than 2% juice extract. Normally sold in powdered form, and not carbonated.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Infant formula">Formula</a>
</td>
<td>Typically refers to an artificial replacement for mother's milk.  Not carbonated.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Medicine
</td>
<td>The syrups used to flavor colas were originally produced and sold for their (allegedly) medicinal properties - indeed, the very word "Pepsi" was derived from it being touted as an effective remedy against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dyspepsia">dyspepsia</a> (now more commonly called indigestion). Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_water" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tonic water">tonic water</a>, a carbonated quinine solution, was originally used to treat malaria. (This may have led to "tonic" becoming the traditional Bostonian word for soft drinks - although <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www3.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/03/24/boston-word-tonic-gives-way-soda/QpbSyMXlJvvESSVERxb6iP/story.html">this is changing.)</a> It could also refer to modern uses of Ginger Ale as a folk remedy for an upset stomach, or to the practice of chugging a carbonated beverage to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/how-to-make-yourself-burp">relieve bloating by inducing burping.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Broth">Broth</a>
</td>
<td>Liquid in which bones, meat, fish, or vegetables have simmered.  Often used as a soup base.  Not carbonated.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fool's Champagne
</td>
<td>Carbonated beverage is to champagne what fool's gold (pyrite) is to gold.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sugar Milk

<td>Possibly a reference to sap extracted from the stems &amp; trunks of plants, which is sometimes called "milk", such as "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber#Dandelion">dandelion milk</a>"; Under this convention, a beverage made from the extract of sugar cane stems could be termed "sugar milk". Also, food-grade liquids that superficially resemble mammalian milk are often labeled as "[X] milk" after their source, such as "soy milk" and "almond milk"; Sugar being a major component of milk &amp; milk substitutes, it may make sense to call soda "sugar milk."

<tr>
<td>No word for them
</td>
<td>This region of the US does not have a word for carbonated beverages (according to Randall). Probably a play on "In [language] there is no word for [concept]."  Possibly they do not drink them at all.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Hydro
</td>
<td>A word for water.  Carbonated water does exist, but this word means all forms of water. Possibly a reference to the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterworld" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Waterworld">Waterworld</a>, in which "hydro" is the common term for (scarce and valuable) drinkable water.

<td>A nod to another popular map of the same type, exploring the regional dialects used to describe drinking fountains.  Rhode Island and the eastern portion of Wisconsin are the only two locations where 'Bubbler' is commonly used to refer to drinking fountains, but the word is commonly used in surrounding areas to depict the strong variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rhoticity in English">rhoticity</a> present, some saying 'bubblah' in for example Boston, and others saying 'water fountain'.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Mouthbuzz
</td>
<td>Perhaps referring to the feeling of drinking a carbonated beverage, where the releasing carbonation almost 'buzzes' in the mouth.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Brad's Elixir
</td>
<td>Possibly a reference to "Brad's Drink", the original name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pepsi">Pepsi</a> when it was invented by Caleb Bradham in 1893. The word "elixir" is defined as "a sweetened liquid usually containing alcohol that is used in medication either for its medicinal ingredients or as a flavoring". "Elixir" was misspelled in the original version of this comic as "elixer".

<tr>
<td>Hot Water
</td>
<td>Not carbonated.  Not even in Jacuzzi and hot tubs. May reference how boiled water forms bubbles before it actually comes to a boil.

<td>An old term for the element <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, a metallic liquid in its pure form at room temperature. It should also be noted that mercury is a toxin and in most cases it is medically contraindicated against drinking mercury as a beverage.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Glug
</td>
<td>Onomatopoeia, referring to the sound of swallowing a large amount of liquid.  Or possibly referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gl%C3%B6gi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Glögi">gl&#246;gg</a> (pronounced "glug"), a Swedish beverage similar to mulled wine.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Water Plus
</td>
<td>Technically the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Plus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Water Plus">a British water retail services provider</a>, this likely refers to the prevalence of "plus" as a preposition in branding nomenclature (e.g.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google+">Google+</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_8_Plus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IPhone 8 Plus">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up_Plus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:7 Up Plus">7 Up Plus</a>, etc.). Also reminiscent of "Milk Plus," the drugged milk from the movie A Clockwork Orange.

I'm wondering what the joke behind the weird shapes of "softie" and "punch" are about. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Cgrimes85" title="User:Cgrimes85">Cgrimes85</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cgrimes85&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cgrimes85 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:22, 6 February 2019 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The shapes could easily be random. But at first glance the "softie" shape vaguely represents areas where Mormons represent more than 50% of the population. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Syberiyxx&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Syberiyxx (page does not exist)">Syberiyxx</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Syberiyxx&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Syberiyxx (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:07, 6 February 2019 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I fixed the explanation with the correct interpretation of the two shapes. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:N0lqu" title="User:N0lqu">-boB</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:N0lqu" title="User talk:N0lqu">talk</a>) 21:27, 6 February 2019 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My additions had disappeared, but it looks to have been by accident, and Shamino put them back.  Thanks!

<dl><dd>The “bubbler” term is used in some areas of Wisconsin, too; I wonder how that happened. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.59.108" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.59.108">172.68.59.108</a> 17:31, 6 February 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I was surprised to see 'bubbler' avoided Boston.  Living in the suburbs of Boston, which are in the 'bubbler' area, we always called them 'water fountains', but we talked about how people in downtown Boston would say 'bubblah' instead, which somebody from the city verified once.  Later I moved to the Harvard/Cambridge area (is that Randall's area?) and people seemed to say 'water fountain' to me, although I might not have noticed, or maybe they were all college kid types, dunno.  Maybe the point is that in the highlighted area, people weirdly _don't_ refer to water fountains as bubblers, and the reason for this is that it is how soda/pop is referred to. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.62.10" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.62.10">172.69.62.10</a> 23:50, 6 February 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Growing up in the New York metropolitan area in the 70's, my family sometimes used the term "bubbler", but only to refer to those drinking fountains where the water is projected straight up.  We never used it for the more common kind where the water is projected at an angle.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Shamino" title="User:Shamino">Shamino</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Shamino&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Shamino (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:37, 6 February 2019 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>It <i>could</i> be, but I see no evidence of that in this comic; there's no other reference to currencies <i>or</i> cryptography here, so there's not much to go on. However, looking through past comics, I see many instances where Randall used "crypto" to mean "cryptography" but <i>no</i> instances where he used just the term "crypto" alone to mean "cryptocurrency". Randall Munroe seems pretty well versed on both topics &amp; I don't think he thinks that word means what you think he thinks that word means. Crypto = cryptography. Crypto ≠ crypto-currency; hence the existence of the compound term crypto+currency in the first place. </dd>

</p><p>On "fluid": the term "fluid" can refer to liquids and gasses both, so perhaps it's a deliberate reference to the fact that carbonated beverages contain both liquid and (rapidly decompressing) gas?
</p><p>I doubt that "True Water" is a reference to True Blood. Randall doesn't exactly seem like a vampire guy to me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.189.241" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.189.241">172.68.189.241</a> 00:50, 7 February 2019 (UTC)

</p><p>The Söde section is just south of Seattle and so is probably a reference to the SoDo section of Seattle (which was also parodied on South Park's 19th season as SodoSopa) Should I add these to the explanation? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ansarya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ansarya (page does not exist)">Ansarya</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ansarya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ansarya (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:13, 7 February 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I'm wondering if the term "Hydro" in Upstate NY bordering Canada is a play on the common Canadian use of "Hydro" to mean electricity <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:B0xertw1n&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:B0xertw1n (page does not exist)">B0xertw1n</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:B0xertw1n&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:B0xertw1n (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:15, 7 February 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I know meltwater is used as a term for water from melted glaciers, icebergs or just ice and snow in general. I have heard Melt used to refer to glacier water in specific twice in Canada. I also know people ride boats up to icebergs just to grab some ice for a drink. Considering the region, I wouldn't be surprised if both Melt and Boat Drink refer to that. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:D&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:D (page does not exist)">D</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:D&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:D (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:22, 7 February 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I wonder why he used five colors for the map, given the four color theorem I would never be able to resist using four only for maps like this.

</p><p>Is this a Republican gerrymander?
</p>
<ul><li> Ichor goes red.</li>
<li> You-Know-What goes red.</li>
<li> I can't tell which way Ohio Tea would go, given that Arizona is a swing state, and very little of the populated areas have changed.</li>
<li> The Wet Drink is clearly more Republican, as the section bordering Mexico is gone.</li>
<li> Punch is red, even though Colorado is typically blue.</li>
<li> Atlanta is in the "Tang" region, not the "Fool's Champagne" region. Atlanta is not enough to make Tang blue.</li>
<li> Skim Shake contains a lot of African-Americans, but it still seems to be red.</li>
<li> Glug is red. I can't tell about Skim Shake or Quicksilver.</li>
<li> Fluid excludes Raleigh, which is enough to make it likely/solid Republican, despite North Carolina only leaning Republican.</li>
<li> Mead is red, even though Minnesota leans Democratic.</li>
<li> Kid's Coffee excludes Detroit, making it dark red.</li>
<li> I honestly can't tell which way Medicine goes. It contains Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Pittsburg, and Buffalo, but also a lot of rural areas. Cincinnati and eastern Pennsylvania are excluded.</li>
<li> Hydro goes red.</li>
<li> Broth goes red, even though Virginia is blue. Look at how Hot Water is "packed" with Democrats.</li></ul>
<p>The only thing I have against this idea is that Capri goes blue, and a Republican gerrymander would probably not include the entirety of Indiana. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.245" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.245">162.158.79.245</a> 14:01, 7 February 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd>What? Where are you two getting your information on this subject? Both the AMA &amp; WHO have published warnings about the dangers of mercury ingestion. It is medically classified as a toxin &amp; regulated as an industrial pollutant. Due to the very small quantities required for a spill to elevate mercury levels beyond accepted risk limits in a water table, &amp; the high rate of vaporization &amp; accordant inhalation risk, many municipalities &amp; medical organizations have banned the sale of mercury containing thermometers, altogether. Ingesting a single gram of mercury is sufficient to risk permanent damage, &amp; it's worse if inhaled, which is easy to do because it vaporizes at a relatively low temperature. Mercury inhibits selenium uptake. Even the relatively low absorption rate of elemental mercury within the gastrointestinal tract is still sufficient to warrant serious medical warnings &amp; safety regulations. Unless you can present some peer-reviewed studies indicating that drinking mercury is safe, I don't understand how you can claim it's "hardly harmful at all if swallowed". Bottom line: <i><b>Mercury is a toxin.</b></i> I'm putting it back in. </dd>

<p>Heh. Lots of these funny names might remind specific users of specific things, but it's foolish of us to say that those names are surely references to those things.

</p><p>I don't understand, I've never heard anyone refer to sodas in general as "Coke" unless it was a Coke-like drink (aka cola).

</p><p>I think "hydro" is a reference to the fact that in that region (and Canada) they refer to electric power as "hydro" because it comes from hydroelectric plants, so it IS a regional dialect change, but for utility power not soft drinks. 23:20, 8 February 2019 (UTC)
</p><p>I also though "hydro" was a reference to the Canadian oddity of calling electricity "hydro".
