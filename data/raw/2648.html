<p>In this comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> mentions to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> that their company spends a lot on chemicals for which you can find formulas online. She suggests assembling chemicals from atoms "bought in bulk," holding a sheet of paper with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Empirical formula">empirical formula</a> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, which designates <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=C6H5NO2">hundreds of compounds</a> including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nitrobenzene">nitrobenzene</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Niacin">niacin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isonicotinic_acid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Isonicotinic acid">isonicotinic acid</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picolinic_acid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Picolinic acid">picolinic acid</a>, followed by their component elements listed with quantities and prices. The ambiguity of chemical formulae is one of the jokes in the comic.
</p><p>While many expensive chemicals are composed of inexpensive and easily available elements, "assembling" those elements into specific molecules is rarely as simple as Megan implies. That work is the primary purpose of the global chemical industry. In-house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chemical synthesis">chemical synthesis</a> is usually not cost effective, because end users have limited time and are generally unable to leverage the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> inherent in bulk manufacturing by specialist industrial firms.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880393/">[1]</a> They are also not able to benefit from synergies by simultaneous synthesizing different compounds. However, we don't know whether Megan and Cueball work in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIHxPc7EpP8">laboratory,</a> factory, or some other industrial setting. If they need chemicals in bulk, or only very small quantities, synthesizing them might be cost effective. In any case, producing chemicals from their constituent elements, or — as is far more common — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Precursor (chemistry)">precursor compounds</a>, is difficult and time-consuming, usually requires expensive equipment, and is often fraught with peril.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwW2owNWgc">[2]</a> It's conceivable that this could change as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology develop, but it is a far fetch given the relative ease of synthesizing chemicals from other chemicals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nitrobenzene">Nitrobenzene</a>, one of the C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> compounds, is an excellent example because it is explosive and extremely toxic, and its synthesis is highly exothermic, making it one of the most dangerous syntheses in the chemical industry.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.icheme.org/media/10339/xiii-paper-36.pdf">[3]</a> Such issues answer Cueball's question as to why more places don't manufacture their own compounds from atoms. Megan seems to be imagining synthesis as a much simpler process without reactivity, energy release, or hazardous intermediate substances. The characters' naivety also gives rise to the humor of the comic.
</p><p>"Big Molecule" is an <a href="/wiki/index.php/2130:_Industry_Nicknames" title="2130: Industry Nicknames">industry nickname like Big Oil or Big Pharma</a>, amusing in its own right, and conceivably implying that the chemical industry is conspiring to prevent end users from synthesizing their own compounds. Big Oil and Big Pharma are real industrial nicknames, referring to large industries run by a relatively small number of massive and hugely profitable companies.  These companies are sufficiently wealthy and influential that they exert significant control over the marketplace, and even over government policy. Consequently, many consumers believe that their influence allows them to price products unfairly and prevent competition. "Big Molecule," on the other hand, is not a common term.  It could be used to refer to the global chemical industry, but that industry is neither seen as being excessively powerful, nor does it impact consumers as visibly, and so doesn't merit a similar nickname.  <i>Literal</i> big molecules tend to be more difficult to synthesize than little ones, with the difficulty increasing more rapidly than the size.  Some big molecules such as synthetic DNA are constructed chainwise from sub-units, and in these cases the difficulty is (approximately) linear with size.
</p><p>Megan is holding a note listing how many of the four types of atoms she needs to build one molecule of the compound she wants to assemble. The paper seems to list prices for buying 6 carbon, 5 hydrogen, 1 nitrogen and 2 oxygen atoms, although the units aren't specified and the very small prices are illegible. At the bottom is a sum showing she needs 14 total, again with an illegible price. She is suggesting buying atoms in bulk, which should be even cheaper than buying them individually. However, this is another layer of humor, as you can neither buy individual atoms or get a price for them, showing her lack of understanding of chemistry. An actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bill of materials">bill of materials</a> for a chemical compound synthesis from constituent elements alone would list the elements converting their number of atoms to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mole (unit)">moles</a>, then <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/chemistry/mole">to mass</a> for solids and some fluids or to volume at the available pressure and temperature for other fluids, and then to the purchase price, which would usually need to be rounded up to match the next largest size available from suppliers. Also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Reagent">reagents</a> are usually necessary for syntheses, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Reactant">reactants</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Solvent">solvents</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Buffer solution">buffers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Catalyst">catalysts</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Enzyme">enzymes</a>. These can cost more than the compounds' constituents but are sometimes recoverable for reuse, though that may require using additional reagents. In many cases, the cost of the elements would be more than the cost of the compound.  For example, purchasing hydrogen and oxygen from which to make water would cost more than water costs.
</p><p>The title text refers to the fact that older people often complain that "kids these days" don't know how to do things that seemed fundamental to past generations. Randall may have expressed that he dislikes other statements like these in <a href="/wiki/index.php/2165:_Millennials" title="2165: Millennials">previous comics</a>. It may also refer to the decline of home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry_set" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chemistry set">chemistry sets</a> popular from the late 1700s through the early 1980s that encouraged kids to experiment with basic chemical reactions like generating esters or polymers, or the even older decline in home manufacture of gunpowder as was common in the 1800s. Chemical engineering was more widely practiced during the development of plastics, but far fewer people understand how they are made today. Similarly with automobiles, domesticated crops, and many other technologies that progressed through a period of popular attention but became siloed into industries, corporations, governments, or branches of academia. This is happening now with some software, circuitry, and other technologies, where fewer people know how to build and troubleshoot complex devices and systems. Technology users thus lose their ability to build and repair machines and modify their tools themselves, having to rely on paid services instead. Similar to the makerspace movement, community chemical labs have occasionally been cropping up, where people work together to perform citizen science, including occasional chemical synthesis, by sharing community resources; however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biohacking" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Biohacking">biohacking</a> and structural manufacturing are far more common.
</p><p>This comic may have been prompted by recent news that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-07-15/for-the-first-time-in-history-we-can-modify-atomic-bonds-in-a-single-molecule.html">scientists have found a way to assemble and change atoms in individual molecules</a> by modifying their bonds.

<p>Does anyone know the significance of nitrobenzen, the compound indicated? Per Wikipedia " The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (ΔH = −117 kJ/mol)" but I wonder if there's something else too.
<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.237.221" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.237.221">108.162.237.221</a> 20:07, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> It's almost certainly the exothermic (read: potentially explosive) reaction that he's going for. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.207" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.207">172.70.110.207</a> 20:11, 20 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> It is also the formula of Niacin, one of the B vitamins (same atoms, different arrangement)  Possibly this is the point: the molecular formula is ambiguous, there are several well-known chemicals with this formula, with very different properties <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Zeimusu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Zeimusu (page does not exist)">Zeimusu</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Zeimusu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Zeimusu (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:58, 20 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I wouldn't know which way to put this, but "make your own molecules" could be parodying the "build your own PC from bits", "compile your own OS distro", "actually cook food from raw ingredients, not packets" or various other supply/consumer things that some people (those who know enough about what they're doing) will actually do, many people (who don't care to know) won't even consider and some (with a little bit of knowledge, but not actually enough) might find the revelation that they <i>could</i> do some things themselves far more compelling than the valid question of whether they <i>should</i> just leap in and try to do it (making all kinds of mistakes/reinventing various wheels along the way) without further research. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.32" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.32">141.101.99.32</a> 21:14, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>There are also a lot of make-your-own-film-developer nerds, which is a little bit closer in that you're using household items to try to recreate the reactions created by otherwise expensive chemicals. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.130.217" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.130.217">172.70.130.217</a> 22:37, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I never even heard of those. I used to live in a household where there was darkroom equipment, even, so know a little of the process of doing that (more so than academic chemistry lessons) but I'd shy away from trying to substitute like that. If it's a thing, then might be worth linking (when and by who it can be). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.162.155" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.162.155">172.70.162.155</a> 10:33, 21 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Megan could also be so used to using "free and open source" software, where you can download the source code, make some minor modifications for your situation, then compile it and use the executable.  Here the source code is easy to get but the compiling process can be much more challenging. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Nutster" title="User:Nutster">Nutster</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Nutster" title="User talk:Nutster">talk</a>) 16:34, 24 July 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> Equally could be parodying fallacious thinking in corporate procurement that says 'if we build system x in-house, we won't have have to pay some supplier loads of money to do it', which ignores that the supplier is likely leveraging economies of scale by developing for multiple clients, and ignores the costs of supporting and maintaining the system. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.135" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.135">172.70.85.135</a> 12:14, 21 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> It seems to be typical 4chan terminology. Someone who spent some time being influenced there, or maybe one step removed in their own little chan-wannabe dark cave sitting in some other area of the twilight internet taking most of their prompts from the 'real rebels' who are probably just egging them on for their own meta-amusement, but that the stooge(s) would know it. And the repetitious interleving of vandalism modes employed (which are fairly discernible as different until you find the same source has done two or more of the things at once, unifying their identity) indicate a singular whim, if not a singular actor to perform them, who gradually has added new variations to the repertoir of damage to try to be 'clever'.

<p>I wonder if this could be referencing the video game Spacechem?

</p><p>SpaceChem was the first thing I thought of reading the comic.
</p><p>I removed "Similar to the makerspace movement, community chemical labs have been cropping up, where people work together to perform chemical synthesis and other chemistry acts by sharing community resources," because it doesn't seem to be true; see <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://peer.asee.org/the-design-and-impact-of-a-combined-makerspace-wet-lab-and-instructional-design-studio-for-chemical-engineering-curriculum.pdf">[4]</a>.

<dl><dd> I actually was a very fringe part of a group synthesizing coronavirus tests at a community lab, and have elesewhere participated in groups with community labs. I have some neurological issues and have not yet found a citation or reviewed your reference, but the statement is indeed very true. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.135" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.135">172.70.110.135</a> 12:04, 22 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> There is a reason that we as a society house exploratory chemistry labs inside high schools, colleges and universities, but we allow co-ops and makerspaces to host mechanical and manufacturing tools. It's mostly the greater extent of safety equipment, protocols, supervision, and training compared to hand tools and shop equipment, but also the huge regulatory burden of storing thousands of precursor chemicals, many hundreds of which are likely to be deadly poisons, explosive, radioactive, drugs of abuse, potent carcinogens and teratogens, or just absurdly expensive. Have a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIHxPc7EpP8">this video</a> to get an idea of what a modern synthesis lab is like. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.211.90" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.211.90">172.70.211.90</a> 15:25, 22 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> From your link: "In this work I describe the design and impacts of a makerspace at the University of Utah, created specifically for chemical engineering curriculum." -- is your concern the phrasing around "cropping up", that the statement implies more labs here than your experience is that there actually are? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.114.223" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.114.223">172.70.114.223</a> 12:10, 22 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> If you read about what they actually use the makerspaces for, it's mostly glasswork and manufacturing of lab equipment, not synthesis at all. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.33.177" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.33.177">172.69.33.177</a> 14:07, 22 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> It looks like they closed their public access to the chem lab in 2018 when they became Librecycle.
