<p>This comic is a parody of a multitude of mobile-technology related issues that, when brought together, create a general satire of smartphone advertising. It was the first entry in the ongoing <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:xkcd_Phones" title="Category:xkcd Phones">xkcd Phone series</a> with the next <a href="/wiki/index.php/1465:_xkcd_Phone_2" title="1465: xkcd Phone 2">1465: xkcd Phone 2</a> released about nine months later.
</p><p>The advertised features here either make previously useful capabilities useless or add features nobody wants. Except for "your mobile world (going) digital", which is old news.
</p><p>The first generation of cell phones (introduced in the early 1980s) used analog radio signals to send voice traffic - and this was the standard used by first ever smartphone, the IBM Simon. But the second generation (2G) standards, introduced from 1991 onwards, were digital, and analog services had been phased out by 2010 in most countries, long before this comic was published in 2014.
</p><p>To market something as "going digital" implies that the corporation has found a way to integrate computers and/or the internet into a market that previously existed without them; the market for mobile phones has <i>always</i> involved computers,<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> making the xkcd phone's marketing feel dated and clueless.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Explanations_of_features">Explanations of features</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=1363:_xkcd_Phone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Explanations of features">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>From the top, going clockwise:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Custom blend OS:</b> iOS and Android are offered by different conglomerates and run on different kernels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Darwin (operating system)">Darwin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Linux kernel">Linux</a>, respectively).  A "custom blend" would probably be a nightmare to work with. </li>
<li><b>Simulates alternative speed of light:</b> This renders the clock useless as a means of telling time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Speed of light">speed of light</a> is 299,792,458&#160;meters per second; relativistic effects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Time dilation">time dilation</a>, are only noticeable at significant fractions of the speed of light. Since the phone is simulating a much slower speed of light, driving at even highway speeds will cause a significant amount of time dilation. For example, driving at 90&#160;mph (90% of the default simulated speed of light) will give a time dilation factor of about 2.29, causing the clock to advance only 26&#160;minutes for each hour; driving at exactly 100&#160;mph makes the dilation factor infinite and will stop the clock entirely. Driving beyond 100&#160;mph would make the clock start advancing through imaginary/complex time rather than real time, somehow, or maybe make it impossible to drive beyond 100&#160;mph.</li>
<li><b>Wireless:</b> as in cordless phone. This is the bare minimum a phone has to have in order to be a mobile phone, so advertising it as a feature feels dated by decades. The alternative explanation, as in the phone has no wires at all, even inside, would render the phone either useless or extremely advanced technologically.</li>
<li><b>Accelerometer screams in free fall:</b> A humorous function. Rather than having some sort of feature to prevent breakage or cracking when a drop is detected, the phone just makes you more aware of its potential imminent doom.</li>
<li><b>When exposed to light, phone says "Hi!":</b> Bait and switch, and also a build from the previous joke. The implied feature is that the screen or camera will automatically adjust, but instead the phone is weirdly anthropomorphized.</li>
<li><b>FlightAware partnership:</b> This is a reference to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a> flight tracking service. This FlightAware partnership results in the phone playing airplane engine noise whenever a flight passes over the phone's current location, an annoying and arbitrary feature. It may also be superfluous, as such noise may be heard from the plane itself, depending on altitude.
<ul><li>This app was referenced in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1660:_Captain_Speaking" title="1660: Captain Speaking">1660: Captain Speaking</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Realistic case:</b> possibly a joke on various audiovisual devices like gaming consoles that advertise realistic sound, graphics, etc. Of course, applying "realistic" to an actual physical case is ridiculous. Either the case is actually real, or it doesn't actually function as a case. Possible reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/331:_Photoshops" title="331: Photoshops">331: Photoshops</a>, where <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> finds a physical object to not look realistic. Could also be a reference to "case" as in "best case" or "worst case", which would make this the realistic case. This would also be ridiculous. </li>
<li><b>Clear screen:</b> This is a pointless descriptor from the perspective of the consumer. Of course the screen is clear.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> This joke works in tandem with the previous joke, as a play on "clear case, realistic screen," which are both hypothetically viable selling points.</li>
<li><b>Side Facing Camera:</b> There was a recent controversy surrounding an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/spy-cam-peek-i">Indiegogo for a surreptitious, side-mounted camera device</a> for smartphones due to the advertisement of the device as a good way to take creep shots, which are illegal in many places. Widespread dissemination of these devices as a built-in feature would likely result in a sharp increase in delinquency of this nature. May also be an <i>ad absurdum</i> extension of devices with both forward and backward facing cameras.</li></ul>

<p>The ominous warnings and disclaimers in the title text are probably a reference to the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> parody ad for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Fun_Ball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Happy Fun Ball">Happy Fun Ball</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/GmqeZl8OI2M">watch on YouTube</a>).
</p>
<ul><li><b>Presented in partnership with Qualcomm, Craigslist, Whirlpool, Hostess, LifeStyles, and the US Chamber of Commerce.</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> is a semiconductor company that designs and produces chips for mobile phones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Corporation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Whirlpool Corporation">Whirlpool Corporation</a> is a large American multinational manufacturer and marketer of home appliances, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_(website)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Whirlpool (website)">Whirlpool</a> is a prominent Australian tech forum website, originally created for discussion of Australian broadband providers but now extending to cover general tech topics, including mobile phones. The other companies and lobbying organizations mentioned here have no association with mobile phones , though there is a long history of unrelated companies attempting to leverage their respective brands to help promote each other. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Chamber_of_Commerce" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:US Chamber of Commerce">US Chamber of Commerce</a> is a lobbyist group known for sponsoring political campaign ads, so their partnership with a phone manufacturer would imply some sort of political motive to its design.</li>
<li><b>Manufactured on equipment which also processes peanuts.</b> A warning often seen on candy and other foods for people with a peanut allergy. It is highly unlikely that equipment used to produce mobile phones would also process food.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li><b>Price includes 2-year Knicks contract.</b> Mobile phones are often sold by phone companies in combination with a cell phone contract. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:New York Knicks">Knicks</a>, a team with a history of questionable personnel decisions, might in fact be willing to offer 2-year contracts (worth at least $1,100,000) to cellular phone purchasers regardless of their skill at basketball, though the vast majority of customers wouldn't be interested.</li>
<li><b>Phone may extinguish nearby birthday candles.</b> A rather oddly specific capability, which might also be annoying for anyone attempting to host a birthday party. As to how it would do this, a very powerful directional speaker would be able to blow out a nearby candle, but the speakers in mobile phones aren't going to be that big. It is also difficult to work out how the phone would detect and identify birthday candles.  Perhaps when the phone senses light from candles, it says "hi" (see above) so loudly that they blow out.</li>
<li><b>If phone ships with Siri, return immediately; do not speak to her and ignore any instructions she gives.</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Siri">Siri</a> is a virtual personal assistant application for Apple devices. Not speaking to it and not following its instructions would defeat its purpose. It may suggest that a malevolent "Siri AI" has sneaked itself onto some devices, at the manufacturing stage, for some diabolical purpose. This may be a reference to the Companion Cube in the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Portal (video game)">Portal</a>, in which the player is instructed by GLaDOS to disregard its advice if the cube appears to be animate, or it may be a reference to the <a href="/wiki/index.php/1450:_AI-Box_Experiment" title="1450: AI-Box Experiment">AI-Box Experiment</a>, in which allowing the AI to engage you in conversation will almost certainly result in it successfully convincing you to let it out of the box (here, probably connecting the phone to a data network).</li>
<li><b>Do not remove lead casing.</b> A mobile phone encased in lead would not function because it could not transmit or receive data. Devices that emit high levels of ionizing radiation are often encased in lead, but a phone that would emit that level of radiation would be unhealthy to carry around. If encased in sufficient lead to mitigate the danger, it would be uncomfortably heavy. This might be reference to <a href="/wiki/index.php/925:_Cell_Phones" title="925: Cell Phones">925: Cell Phones</a> where Randall makes fun of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WHO">WHO</a> claiming that cell phones might cause cancer despite huge studies showing the opposite. This could also mean the device is an actual bananaphone as regular phones emit no ionizing radiation (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/radiation">xkcd Radiation Dose Chart</a>). Regrettably, the lead casing would render the phone inedible, although this somewhat mitigates the issues with having been manufactured on equipment that also processes peanuts.</li>
<li><b>Phone may attract/trap insects; this is normal.</b> Some plants, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_flytrap" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Venus flytrap">Venus flytrap</a>, attract and trap insects, but mobile phones are not known to exhibit this behavior.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> This could possibly be a play on software <i>bugs</i> being introduced to the phone more easily than usual, depending on the specifics of its operating system (made much more likely by its apparent custom-made blended OS (see above)). Also may be a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasberry_crazy_ants" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rasberry crazy ants">Rasberry crazy ants</a> which are attracted to electronics.</li>
<li><b>Volume adjustable (requires root).</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Android rooting">Rooting</a> is the method to gain privileged access on Android phones, allowing one to access features that normal users would not and should not normally modify. Adjusting the volume should be available to any user and should not be restricted to root access only.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li><b>If you experience sudden tingling, nausea, or vomiting, perform a factory reset immediately.</b> These symptoms are usually associated with chemical or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_poisoning" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Radiation poisoning">radiation poisoning</a>. It is unclear why these would be cured by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_reset" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Factory reset">factory reset</a>, though software apps could plausibly be used to display nauseating visual effects. Radiation poisoning as a possible cause may also relate to the lead casing mentioned above. It is unclear how a (software-only) factory reset would repair a damaged lead casing. This may also be a reference to the series of similar disclaimers at the end of many medical advertisements.</li>
<li><b>Do not submerge in water; phone will drown.</b> Most phones are not waterproof and will probably short-circuit when submerged. The specific term of drowning would however imply that the phone breathes air (which actually would be possible if it had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93air_battery" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lithium–air battery">Lithium–air battery</a>).</li>
<li><b>Exterior may be frictionless.</b> The front of a smartphone is usually made of glass and should have a surface with very low friction. The back of a phone is usually made from a material that has higher friction to make it pleasant to hold and to make sure it doesn't slide off objects it is placed on. A <a href="/wiki/index.php/669:_Experiment" title="669: Experiment">completely frictionless surface</a> would make it almost impossible to hold and would make it very susceptible to drops (at which point the phone will scream).</li>
<li><b>Prolonged use can cause mood swings, short-term memory loss, and seizures.</b> These are all side effects that are associated with certain kinds of medication or radiation treatment of the brain and would not be acceptable for mobile phones. This may be the explanation for the memory loss in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1660:_Captain_Speaking" title="1660: Captain Speaking">1660: Captain Speaking</a>.</li>
<li><b>Avert eyes while replacing battery.</b> Actions that would warrant averting your eyes are usually associated with high-intensity light capable of causing eye damage. Depending on the specific energy source, this may be accompanied by high levels of other types of radiation (e.g. making an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:X-ray">X-ray</a> photo). This may hint that the phone might be powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Radionuclide">radionuclide</a> battery which would explain the lead casing and the possible radiation side effects. A phone that emits X-ray radiation would not be healthy to be around. Alternately, this may be a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_Of_The_Covenant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ark Of The Covenant">Ark Of The Covenant</a>, implying that gazing upon the battery or the compartment wall behind it is forbidden on pain of severe punishment.

<p>Travelling at above the simulated speed of light should give an imaginary time dilation, not a negative time dilation.
gamma = 1/sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}
Thus, after such travel, the value of the clock would be a complex number. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.35" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.35">108.162.219.35</a> 15:42, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>You guys should probably clarify that the relativisic affects actually depend on how long your trip is or how long you wait to sync your phone.  For relativity to be observable on a 12 hour trip, Minimum speed for a phone would have to be 300 m/s or 3000 m/s for the clock to measure even a microsecond/millisecond difference in time. This is well known thanks to the certain  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Velocity_and_gravitational_time_dilation_combined-effect_tests">time dilation experiments with planes</a>. Your GPS chip helps account for an error of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Relativity">7 to 47 microseconds per day</a>. My point is in terms of time dilation, relativity mattering depends on how long a trip or waiting for synchronization is. By synching, I literally mean with the atomic time clock or with a GPS satellite. The synchronization of your phone with satellites is actually a couple of hundred microseconds, so normally even a light changing clock might not have as noticable changes as you might think. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.225" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.225">108.162.238.225</a> 13:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.238.225" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.238.225">108.162.238.225</a> 13:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt> relativistic effect</dt></dl>
<p>Forgive me if I'm wrong, I'm not a physicist but the above explanation says that relativistic time dilation affects only occur at a significant fraction of the speed of light. It is my understanding that time dilation occurs at any speed, but is only perceptible/noticeable/measurable at very large fraction of the speed of light. Unless I'm mistaken the above it should reflect this. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.56.91" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.56.91">173.245.56.91</a> 22:24, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dt> putting "Relative" back into relativity</dt></dl>
<p>First time poster, please forgive my transgressions&#160;:)
My understanding regarding relativistic effects is that, for a given frame of reference (e.g. phone operator travelling at 0.9c) would be absolutely none. Relativistic effects (as I understand them) would only apply between two different frames of reference. The only effect I can see in this case is if you are moving towards, or away from the phone while operating, and red/blue shift of the radio frequencies. In general, wifi and bluetooth are used locally so wouldn't apply; only the phone network would be affected.
</p><p>Also, perhaps the adjustable speed of light is a reference to the the game "A slower speed of light" by MIT Game Lab <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/">http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/</a> (in which you walk around collecting objects; each object slows light down, and increases relativistic effects).

<p><b>Root needed</b>
</p><p>I think that needing root for ajust the volume may be a allusion people needing to root Android to change fonts or to take screenshots (untill version 4.x). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:FlavianusEP&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:FlavianusEP (page does not exist)">FlavianusEP</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FlavianusEP&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:FlavianusEP (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:04, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

<b>Alternative meaning: The spirit of xkcd</b>
</p><p>I think there's a secondary possible interpretation for this comic -- that the various features of the phone represent the overall "spirit" or "attitude" of xkcd, in a way reminiscent of an early strip -- <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/207/">http://xkcd.com/207/</a> -- about "what xkcd means." More specifically, a common theme in xkcd is taking advanced concepts in science and technology, and applying them to whimsical, humorous, impractical, or outright impossible uses. Several of phone's features -- such as the simulated speed of light -- touch on the same theme. Wordplay, another common xkcd theme, is present as well; and the anthropomorphism of technology, along with making devices appear 'cute', is also present, and also is something that has come up in xkcd many times in the past.
</p><p>The comic is called "xkcd Phone", after all -- I think simultaneously with being a parody of phone advertisements, the comic is also meant to show us what a phone that fits into the xkcd world would be like. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.241.114" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.241.114">108.162.241.114</a> 17:52, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p>I agree; it seems like a basic comic at first glance, but I'm wondering if there's a meta-meaning if you put all of the pieces together. Each feature, and warning, is a clue to the overarching purpose of the phone, or to the true joke that this phone embodies. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Imtrbl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Imtrbl (page does not exist)">imtrbl</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Imtrbl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Imtrbl (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:11, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p><b>Blowing out candles....</b>
</p><p>For the birthday candles thing: I do remember seeing a video ad for an app back when the iphone was first opened up to outside developers that would turn the phone into a fan, and it demonstrated that it was strong enough to blow out a birthday candle. Seemed quite useless at the time. Still does today for that matter  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.215.47" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.215.47">108.162.215.47</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.215.47&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.215.47 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p><b>Side-facing camera</b>
</p><p>I thought the joke here was that the camera <i>only</i> contained a side-facing camera rather than a side camera in addition to a front and back camera.  While you can see the camera on the side, you don't see a camera on the front and they don't talk about a rear camera.  It'd be pretty annoying to use a side-facing camera for anything but the surreptitious case you described. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:S&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:S (page does not exist)">S</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:S&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:S (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:58, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p><b>Do not submerge in water</b>
</p><p>I assumed this was also referencing the 4chan, etc pranks with the waterproof iPhone <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.55.79" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.55.79">173.245.55.79</a> 18:41, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p><b>Wireless</b>
</p><p>A completely wireless phone would not be unuseable. The only wire phones need nowadays is for recharging their battery, but this can be done by induction, like with the Qi system with which some Nokia and Google (Nexus) phones are compatible. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Zoyd&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Zoyd (page does not exist)">Zoyd</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoyd&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Zoyd (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p><b>FoxTrot reference?</b> I think this one could be a reference to th J-Pad in the foxtrot webcomic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.foxtrot.com/2012/03/03042012/">http://www.foxtrot.com/2012/03/03042012/</a> . Foxtrot's author has already published a guest comic for XKCD a few years ago, so Randall should know about it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.212.203" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.212.203">108.162.212.203</a> 16:31, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
</p><p><b>Cell Phones Cure Cancer?</b>
</p><p>I know, I know, the editor who added "makes fun of the WHO claiming that cell phones might cause cancer despite huge studies showing the opposite" probably didn't mean that, but it's kind of amusing to interpret it that way. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nyperold&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nyperold (page does not exist)">Nyperold</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nyperold&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nyperold (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:42, 15 June 2016 (UTC)

<p>Some fake phones actually feature things like that. See: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubd2dX0YeSI">this</a>.

</p><p>"Prolonged use may cause mood swings, short-term memory loss, or seizures" could also be referencing the adverse health effects commonly associated with spending too much time using a smartphone. Mood swings could be caused by the bewildering variety of content found on social media apps, which could result in the user's mood changing rapidly as they browse through unrelated topics that influence the way they feel. Short-term memory loss could be attributed to the fact that many users rely on their smartphones to take notes and set reminders. If a person depends almost solely on their phone to remember things for them, their short-term memory may degrade over time due to disuse. I don't know how seizures fits into this analogy, but it might've been included for the reasons described in the main explanation page. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.33.77" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.33.77">172.69.33.77</a> 20:13, 7 April 2021 (UTC)
