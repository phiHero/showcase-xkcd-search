<p>The comic depicts a conversation between <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a>, discussing the fact that giving people security advice in the past has failed to improve their internet security, and in some cases even made things worse.  One such example is telling people to create complicated passwords containing numbers and symbols, which not only made the passwords harder to remember (leading people to create huge security risks by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/hacked-french-network-exposed-its-own-passwords-during-tv-interview/">leaving post-it notes with their passwords on their computer monitor</a>), but did not actually make those passwords harder to crack (see <a href="/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength" title="936: Password Strength">936: Password Strength</a>).
</p><p>As a result, Cueball suggests using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Reverse psychology">reverse psychology</a> and give out bad advice instead, in hopes of achieving a positive effect. The last panel contains a list with 13 security tips, which are parodies of actual security tips. The title text is just one more tip. See <a href="#Security_tips">table</a> below for explanations for all 14 tips.

<td>Print out this list and keep it in your bank safe deposit box (header)
</td>
<td>This is a standard recommendation for documents that must be kept secure because they are irreplaceable and/or contain sensitive information. However this list itself is easily replaceable and the contents will be well-known, so storing it in a safe place is totally unnecessary.  Putting it in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Safe deposit box">safe deposit box</a> would even be counterproductive since the list can only serve its purpose as a ready reminder if it's easily accessible to everyone. So when people fail to follow this tip, they may end of keeping it in a place where they have easy access to the tips so they may also fail to follow all the others.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip1">
<td>Don't click links to websites
</td>
<td>The usual tip is "Don't click on <i>suspicious</i> website links" or "Don't click any links in suspicious emails". The comic's variation instead tells users not to click on any links to any websites, which essentially stops them from using the World Wide Web altogether. So this tip is not really helping, as the opposite of this would be to click on all links. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sketchywebsite.net">This is an example website that showcases an extreme example of what <i>could</i> (probably wouldn't (this is not advice)) happen if you clicked on a suspicious link.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip2">
<td>Use prime numbers in your password
</td>
<td>It is usually recommended that one uses numbers in one's password, to increase its entropy, making it harder to find with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Brute-force attack">brute force</a> attack. In contrast the comic suggests using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prime numbers">prime numbers</a> in one's password. Large prime numbers are an essential part of modern cryptography and security systems, when used in algorithms that are computed by machines.  They don't have any effect when used by humans in passwords, except for maybe making it harder to remember. In addition, if people were to regularly use prime numbers in their passwords, it would actually make passwords <i>easier</i> to guess, as it would substantially reduce the number of possible passwords people may choose from.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip3">
<td>Change your password manager monthly
</td>
<td>It is often recommended to change passwords on a regular basis and to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Password manager">password manager</a>. Password managers are programs which can help users create, store, and change their passwords easily and securely. Changing password managers monthly would involve copying all stored passwords from one manager to another, which would be quite impractical and has no security benefit.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip4">
<td>Hold your breath while crossing the border
</td>
<td>At some border crossings, government agents may search computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.  The usual advice for such situations ranges from asserting your rights to resetting all devices and deleting all data prior to crossing a border.  Holding one's breath can potentially prevent inhaling germs or poisons in some situations, though useless in the context of computer security.  These two topics mixed in the same advice won't achieve anything, but if you hold your breath for too long you could pass out when crossing, or look stressed/suspicious and invite even more scrutiny. This could also be a reference to the superstition of holding one's breath when passing a graveyard, or similarly to the movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spirited Away">Spirited Away</a></i>, where the main character is instructed to hold her breath while crossing the bridge that acts as the border between the human and spirit world. In any case, holding one's breath while browsing the Internet would have no useful effect, supernatural or otherwise.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip5">
<td>Install a secure font
</td>
<td>A real tip might be "Install a secure browser" especially when many people used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Internet Explorer 6">Internet Explorer 6</a>. Secure fonts do exist and are designed to make checks difficult to alter, but using one on a computer would not help one's internet security. May also refer to Google Chrome <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/EITest-Nabbing-Chrome-Users-Chrome-Font-Social-Engineering-Scheme">"Install missing font"</a> malware.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip6">
<td>Use a 2-factor smoke detector
</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Multi-factor authentication">Two factor authentication</a> describes the practice of using two different identification factors (such as a password and a code from a secure token) to authenticate the user. A two factor smoke detector presumably uses two or more factors to identify <i>smoke</i> (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector#Ionization" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Smoke detector">ionization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector#Photoelectric" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Smoke detector">photoelectric</a>). Such devices <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://alarmspecs.com">actually exist</a>, but, while improving the user's general safety, they do nothing to improve their internet security.
<p>A month before this comic the newest <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:xkcd_Phones" title="Category:xkcd Phones">xkcd Phone</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1809:_xkcd_Phone_5" title="1809: xkcd Phone 5">1809: xkcd Phone 5</a>, was released with a 28-factor authentication.

<tr id="tip7">
<td>Change your maiden name regularly
</td>
<td>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_name" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Maiden name">maiden name</a> is the family name that a woman has at birth. (The gender-neutral term is "birth name" or "birth surname"; it is unclear whether this "advice" is meant to apply only to women.) Security experts frequently criticize the concept of security questions like "what is your mother's maiden name?", on the basis that they can often be deduced from publicly available information. In the sense that it refers to a historical fact, a maiden name cannot be changed retroactively, although in the sense that it refers to the last name on one's birth certificate, in some narrow cases this <i>can</i> be amended. For instance, when someone is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Adoption">adopted</a> and takes their adoptive parent's last name, in many jurisdictions a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Legal fiction">legal fiction</a> holds that they have had that last name since birth, and governments will issue new birth certificates to that effect. However, it is unlikely for anyone to be able to amend the surname on their birth certificate more than once, and impossible to do so "regularly".
<p>A real tip for dealing with security questions is to enter false data.

<tr id="tip8">
<td>Put strange USB drives in a bag of rice overnight
</td>
<td>The usual security tip is "Don't plug strange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:USB flash drive">USB drives</a> into your computer," because sometimes attackers leave USB devices with malicious programs lying around, hoping that people will plug them into target computers out of curiosity. This tip states that you should "put USB drives in a bag of rice overnight" which is a common technique for drying out water-damaged devices, due to rice's absorbent qualities. This would not clean the drive of viruses, and unless the drive was wet (perhaps because you found it outside due to it being called "strange") it would not do anything. In <a href="/wiki/index.php/1598:_Salvage" title="1598: Salvage">1598: Salvage</a>, another attempt is made to salvage something unconventional with rice, and here it is shown that Randall considers the rice drying of a wet mobile is a myth, so this is yet another jab at the idea.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip9">
<td>Use special characters like &amp; and&#160;%
</td>
<td>You can use special characters to increase the entropy/strength of your password, though as described in <a href="/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength" title="936: Password Strength">936: Password Strength</a>, that often leads to passwords that are hard to remember but not particularly strong.  The password context is missing here, and in everyday situations the characters &amp; and&#160;% are not special. These two characters are often disallowed in passwords because of their relevance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:SQL">SQL</a> (a common database query language). If these characters were used in a password, a badly written security system using SQL could have severe bugs (and security vulnerabilities) similar to the security flaw in <a href="/wiki/index.php/327:_Exploits_of_a_Mom" title="327: Exploits of a Mom">327: Exploits of a Mom</a>.

<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tor (anonymity network)">Tor</a> is a software solution to provide anonymity on the web for its users. The website <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tor.com">Tor.com</a> is the website of fantasy and sci-fi book publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Books" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tor Books">Tor Books</a>, which has no relation to the Tor-network.

<td>Use a burner's phone
</td>
<td>A play on using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepay_mobile_phone" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Prepay mobile phone">burner phone</a> (a cheap/disposable cell phone like those purchased at 7-11, often used for drug deals or other activity one might not want traced), and using the cell phone of a burner, i.e. a person who habitually uses marijuana (or, less likely, a person who goes to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Burning Man">Burning Man festival</a>).

<tr id="tip12">
<td>Get an SSL certificate and store it in a safe place
</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Transport Layer Security">SSL/TLS</a> is a protocol for securing connections on the internet. To check if someone is who they claim to be, you can check the individual's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Public key certificate">certificate</a>. Such a certificate has to be public; storing it in a safe place makes the certificate useless. You have to store the private key that matches the certificate in a safe place, else someone could steal the identity.
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip13">
<td>If a border guard asks to examine your laptop, you have a legal right to challenge them to a chess game for your soul.
</td>
<td>This tip is a reference to the common trope <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath"><span style="background: #eef;" title="Warning: TV Tropes. See comic 609.">Chess with Death</span></a>, in which a mortal challenges a god to a game or challenge, often for their life. This version of the trope traces back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman's</a> film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Seal" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Seventh Seal">The Seventh Seal</a>, in which the protagonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Seal#Synopsis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Seventh Seal">challenges Death</a> to a game of chess. But instead of avoiding death, this tip suggests you have the right to do the same to get out of handing your devices over to a border guard. (This trope is also featured in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/393">393: Ultimate Game</a>).
</td></tr>
<tr id="tip14">
<td><b>Title Text</b>: Never give your password or bank account number to anyone who doesn't have a blue check mark next to their name.
</td>
<td>The usual security tip here is <i>"only trust Twitter accounts claiming to be legitimate if they have a blue check mark next to their name"</i>, which means that the account is verified as legitimate. This tip suggests only giving your <i>password</i> to verified accounts, although you shouldn't give your password to <i>any</i> account. Twitter Verification would be revisited in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1914:_Twitter_Verification" title="1914: Twitter Verification">1914: Twitter Verification</a>.
<p>It also refers to problems especially visible in the US banking system, where there is very little security for direct account drafts, and because of that it is advised there to keep the account number as secret as possible. In contrast, in Europe giving your account number to someone is one of the most common ways to get paid.
</p><p>A related tip might be "Never give your password or bank details to a website that doesn't have a padlock icon next to the URL". In some browsers, if you access a secure website, there will be a padlock icon in the browser indicating you've connected to a secure website using the secure https protocol.  It doesn't provide that it is not malicious site, and that is secure to enter.  So this tip treats the verified account icon the same way you might treat a secure website icon.

</p><p>Checking the padlock icon in your browser is not enough to make sure you're really connected to the site you think. You have to check the domain too, to make sure you're not on a typosquatter domain (e.g. explianxkcd.com instead of explainxkcd.com). For really important thing like banking, you should check for an Extended Validation Certificate (Firefox shows the name of the organization running the website beside the padlock to indicate an EV-Certificate).

<dl><dd>Yeah from my, Dutch, view that part also seems strange. Like "I'm not telling you my e-mail address so you can't read my e-mail". Also, anyone you ever sent money to gets to know your account number don't they? After that, can they just walk into a bank saying "Hi I'm John, account number 12345, give me $5000 please"? I'd like a comic showing my accountnumber to test how I'd be hurt by telling the whole world&#160;:)  It gets stranger, in order to get a refund to my credit card I not only had to give my credit card number but the expiry date as well.

<dl><dd>As a North American, around here it seems like allowing someone to know your account number potentially gives a thief a target. If they manage to somehow hack their way into your bank, they now know a valid account number to aim for. Much less suspicious than trying their luck with picking one at random. Also, when we transfer money to each other, the account number doesn't enter into it. I go to my bank's website, start an e-Transfer, and tell it to send X dollars to this email account, and I add a security question - "What's my favourite online comic?" - and the answer - "xkcd". They get the email, select what bank they want to deposit the money to (and login to their bank's website), then give the arranged or known answer to my question. Our account numbers are only used / shared with our own respective banks. - NiceGuy1 <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.219.88" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.219.88">108.162.219.88</a> 07:20, 7 April 2017 (UTC) I finally signed up!

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>That's why these days even credit cards have PIN numbers. And actually, e-Transfers are one of the most secure things I take part in. On both sides of the transfer (i.e. both me and the person I'm paying) we each individually have to have a login setup with our banks, one which uses our bank card number and/or account number (hence part of the reason for a North American's aversion to letting anybody know what it is), and which includes a password like any other login. So, for a person to steal money from me by transfering it out of my account, they'd need my login name (if my bank uses one) or card number or account number - whatever the bank uses to figure out who you are online, plus having to know which one they need to know. The thief can't just set up a new login attached to my account, because I already have one, and banks don't allow a duplicate account. They would also need my password. And for a person to intercept my transfer, in addition to all that (for my recipient this time) they'd also have to intercept the email - which my recipient knows to expect, usually within minutes of when the email will arrive - but also they would need to know the answer to the question I set, which would usually be information you only share with the recipient. I'm reminded of Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, where for security all good people came up with personal security questions to confirm each-others identities. In this case it can be as simple as "Where am I right now?", which you would have discussed when arranging payment, or "Where did we meet?" or "What teacher did we both have?", stuff like that. - NiceGuy1 <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.126.76" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.126.76">162.158.126.76</a> 05:53, 12 April 2017 (UTC) Mine too! <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:07, 13 June 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Because it is trivial to have a link display "schmoo.com" but actually send you to "dastardlyevil.com" when clicked, this is actually usable advice.

This also makes a nice connection with the part about typical usage of burner phones by drug dealers. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User:Ianrbibtitlht">Ianrbibtitlht</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Ianrbibtitlht" title="User talk:Ianrbibtitlht">talk</a>) 14:11, 8 June 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Agreed. I feel like there's no question, Randall is referring to a pot smoker, i doubt there was ever any intent by him to reference Burning Man here. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:24, 13 June 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>

The tip in the title text isn’t technically wrong, just misleading, as you shouldn’t give you passwords or bank info to people without blue checkmarks. You also shouldn’t give them to people with blue checkmarks either, of course, but that doesn’t make the tip wrong. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">PotatoGod</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:44, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
