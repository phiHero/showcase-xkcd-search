This comic references the dichotomy between the literal meaning of the phrase "I could care less" and its idiomatic meaning in American English as an expression of indifference, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/care">synonymous with "I could<b>n't</b> care less."</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCUsPnKD1gk&amp;t=14s">Many</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7O0MFkmpw&amp;t=1m2s">people</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc&amp;t=1m7s">argue</a> that this use is incorrect and the phrase should only be "I couldn't care less," which is the original form of the expression and remains the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.dictionary.com/could-care-less/">standard form in British English</a>. This is the opinion expressed, for example, by the Weird Al Yankovic song "Word Crimes": <blockquote>Like I could care less <br />
<p>That means you do care<br />
</p>
At least a little</blockquote>
<p>However, linguists point out that the strict application of logic to an idiom is inappropriate: many expressions seem on the surface to mean the opposite of the meaning they are used to convey (e.g. "head over heels"), and they <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/03/18/why_i_could_care_less_is_not_as_irrational_or_ungrammatical_as_you_might.html">defend "I could care less" on those grounds</a>. The psychologist Steven Pinker argues in <i>The Language Instinct</i> that the phrase is sarcastic (cf. "Big deal!"), <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/giveadamn.html">while linguist John Lawler explains</a> it as a "Negative Polarity Item," a phrase that is practically only used in negated form, allowing the explicit negation to be omitted (a pattern often found in French).
</p><p>In this comic, Megan feels alone because there is unavoidable difference between her understanding of her own words and the listener's interpretation, so while she sees discussion of semantics as being of potentially high social and emotional value, she doesn't think it has objective value. However, ironically, at the end of the comic, the meaning of "I could care less" with regards to Ponytail's behavior is ambiguous: either Megan is brushing off Ponytail's pedantry because she doesn't care about it (she couldn't care less) or she is hurt by Ponytail's focus on the details of her words rather than the emotional cues she should have learned over the course of their relationship (she actually could care less).
</p><p>The title text refers to another word often used in ways some consider incorrect: "literally" (see <a href="/wiki/index.php/725:_Literally" title="725: Literally">725: Literally</a>). The sentence is also ambiguous, as it may mean that 'literally' or 'figuratively,' the speaker could or couldn't care less. Further, it implies that <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> considers the argument over whether literally may be properly used to mean 'figuratively' is petty in the same way. Later in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1735:_Fashion_Police_and_Grammar_Police" title="1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police">1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police</a> Ponytail is once again on the side of the grammar police and also in this comic the word literally is used.
</p><p>Alternatively, it could mean that Megan cares too much about Ponytail's correction, considering her response to it.
</p><p>In a further alternative, the title text could amount to a self-ironical evaluation on Randall’s part to the effect that he himself might be devoting too much of his time and energy to the meaning of the phrase in question, as evidenced by the comic itself.
</p><p>The inverse image of Megan floating through space in the fourth panel, as well as her long introspection, is a reference to the five-part "Choices" series, starting at <a href="/wiki/index.php/264:_Choices:_Part_1" title="264: Choices: Part 1">264: Choices: Part 1</a>.

</p><p>Another excellent comic by Randall.  In case of interest to anyone a different perspective, David Mitchell did a wonder rant on this... "Dear America... | David Mitchell's SoapBox"

</p><p>The only people who complain about this phrase are pedantic morons who have never heard such things as "head over heels". 
</p><p>Here, I've composed a list of common vernacular/slang idioms which are valid, clear, and diametrically opposed to their original meaning:
</p>
<ul><li> "Head over heels"</li>
<li> "Break a leg"</li>
<li> "It's the shit"</li>
<li> "That's bad"</li>
<li> "She's phat"</li>
<li> "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"</li>
<li> "Irregardless" <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Cwallenpoole" title="User:Cwallenpoole">Cwallenpoole</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cwallenpoole&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cwallenpoole (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small></li></ul>
<dl><dd> "Diametrically opposed" is redundant. The words mean the same thing. Sorry, when the topic of conversation is pedanticism I couldn't resist&#160;:P <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.170" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.170">108.162.221.170</a> 22:17, 12 September 2015 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> I think "diametrically opposed" is not redundant.  I visualize "opposed" = could be points of a circle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees apart.  "diametrically opposed" = exactly 180 degrees apart, to the maximum extent possible.  Whereas "opposed" implies only one dimension of opposite-ness, "diametrically opposed" implies multiple (or colloquially, even all) dimensions of opposite-ness, emphasizing that there is no common ground between the sides in question. 21:07, 15 February 2019 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The reason I dislike "I could care less" is because it just grates me. It disrupts the flow of parsing language in my brain, throwing up a "wait, what?" exception that I have to expend far more mental energy than usual to correctly interpret the meaning of something in my head. I'm not being pedantic for the sake of uptight rule adherence and feeling superior (I play around with language and use it in non-standard forms all the time), I'm pedantic because it causes my brain real difficulties in processing the meaning of what a person's said. I mean I'm a woman with Asperger's (and a British one at that) so maybe things are a little different for me, but that's just why I personally strongly dislike this usage. The things on your list though are all different in some way to "I could care less", at least for me, for example:
<ul><li> "Head over heels" - How is this an opposite meaning, exactly? Doesn't it give a rather nice metaphor for being giddy about something? Being hyperbolic and metaphorical doesn't make it an opposite meaning.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Because your head is <i>normally</i> over your heels. Nothing special about it. Heels over head would be much more interesting...<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Silverpie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Silverpie (page does not exist)">Silverpie</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Silverpie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Silverpie (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:52, 11 September 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Personally I always think of it as your head being bowled over your heels - not the sort of "over" as in "higher gravitational potential energy", but in the same "around" sense of being "turned over" or "starting over". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.218.47" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.218.47">108.162.218.47</a> 03:58, 13 September 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yes, this never sounded "opposite" to me.  Imagine a contortionist with knees and toes on the ground, bent over backwards so that his head is literally over his heels.  This is absolutely not normal.  I took it as meaning something is so exciting/surprising that one contorting himself in unnatural ways. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.255.124" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.255.124">162.158.255.124</a> 21:14, 15 February 2019 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li> "Break a leg" - This is closer to being an opposite, but the exact opposite to wishing an actor good luck would be to wish them bad luck. The mutation to a slightly absurdist statement marks it out as having a different meaning, especially as "break a leg" isn't really used in any other context than to wish a person good luck. While it may be the case that "I could care less" is rarely (if at all) used in its literal form, there's still nothing to mutate it and obviously mark it out as a linguistic special usage case. It's also still how I'd expect someone to phrase it if they were actually telling me they could care less about something.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> The "Vaudeville theory" on this page is where I got my understanding: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_a_leg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_a_leg</a> --EE <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.135" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.135">108.162.216.135</a> 13:52, 11 September 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li> "It's the shit" - Again, this is mutated. People aren't saying "it's shit", the word "the" handily tags it for my brain parser to handle differently.</li>
<li> "That's bad" - Well, you've got me here actually. I mean, context (and tone) makes the meaning obvious but I can't objectively understand why this phrase doesn't cause me the same sort of difficulties at all.

<li> "She's phat" - This is completely literal, "phat" is a slang term meaning excellent or attractive. It may be a mutation of the word "fat" or not, its etymology is uncertain, but it is indisputably a very different word now (much like how "orchids" means a species of flower rather than testicles, and "sinister" hasn't meant left in centuries).</li></ul>

<ul><li> "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar" - This is also completely literal, Freud meant that while he believed many things <i>could</i> have hidden, psychosexual meanings... that while sometimes a person might be puffing on a cigar due to some suppressed phallic desires... they could also just be puffing on a cigar because they're enjoying a nice cigar. That is to say, not everything has a hidden subconscious meaning, and sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, not a substitute object to fellate.</li>
<li> "Irregardless" - Well yes, the suffix added to "regardless" here would usually invert its meaning, but "irregardless" isn't actually a word that existed before it came into use with its current meaning so it's not like saying a previously established and defined word (or phrase).</li></ul></dd>

But I've always internally rationalised it as really saying "If this figure you mention actually were only half of the full price you are <i>truly</i> asking for, the real price would still be considered cheap" (i.e. it's less than half price).

'I couldn't care less' is the standard formulation in the UK, for one.   I always assumed that the US version was originally a variant on this which was later contracted, eg 'I could care less, but not much'.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.99.106" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.99.106">141.101.99.106</a> 07:10, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>Given that xkcd is so pro-science, I don't think the analysis here should endorse the peeve that there's anything wrong with "I could care less" (or use of "literally" as an intensifier), since most actual linguists, experts on how language works, think it's fine. See for example the list of posts dealing with the question here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=21170#more-21170">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=21170#more-21170</a> And of course, the comic itself points out how petty an besides the point this kind of "correction" is. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.92.19" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.92.19">162.158.92.19</a> 07:43, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> As a linguist, regarding the claim that most actual linguists think it's fine, I'd have to respectfully say HELL NO! There is a difference between acknowledging the pragmatic implementation of the phrase, that is, its use in common parlance and the general acceptance and understanding of it, and the question wether or not it is "fine". The comic exemplifies a rather extreme version of the idea "Whatever people use is proper language" - in other words, as long as everybody involved in a conversation gets what is meant, there is no point in arguing semantics, grammer, etc. This is, however, neither the only, nor the dominant approach to language and linguistics. For exapmle, it doesn't answer the question how such an ostensibly paradox use of this phrase came to happen, where (geographically, socially, etc.) the phrase might have originated, and other puzzless regarding the origin of the phrase; this attitude also dismisses any inquiry into how humans process (or ignore) such discrepancies between literal meaning and actual use, and in general, how humans organise, structure, and conecptualise language. Additionally, this comic adds a radical deconstructional (and maybe existential) twist to this perspective by basically saying, "We're all alone, and can never really know or understand anybody else".</dd>
<dd> Such an attitude of total relativism ("Every experience ist entirely subjective and unique") makes my skin crawl. It is by far more presumptious than being a little pedantic about grammar and the use of expressions.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd> I stand by my comment that most linguists would argue that the phrase does not warrant censure, on the grounds that it is (1) in very common use, probably about 5 times as common as "couldn't care less" in American speech, including educated speech, and about half as common in writing, (2) long established, with the OED's first reference back in 1966, only twenty years after it first notes "I couldn't care less" (and with Google Book Search, we can push this back to the 1940s: it occurs repeatedly in the official transcript of a House Congressional Hearing in 1947, for example), (3) idiomatic, so that logical analysis of its strict literal content is not helpful, and (4) analogous to other constructions (in English and other languages) that don't raise any eyebrows or hackles. That does not mean that they don't consider it interesting and worthy of explanation, of course. Indeed, almost all the work of actually trying to explain how "could care less" arose has been done by people who are at pain to point out that they find the phrase unobjectionable (while those who disapprove of it don't seem to get much further than calling it "an ignorant substitution" or a result of "sloppy speech and sloppy writing"). It's of course hard to prove that this is the majority view in academic circles, but I refer to Lawler, Liberman, Pullum, Okrent <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/03/18/why_i_could_care_less_is_not_as_irrational_or_ungrammatical_as_you_might.html">[1]</a>, Pinker, the various dictionaries that list it without deprecation (e.g. RH Webster's: "usage: could care less, the apparent opposite of couldn't care less, is actually used interchangeably with it to express indifference. Both versions occur mainly in informal speech."), and linguistic popularizers such as Grammarist <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://grammarist.com/usage/could-care-less/">[2]</a>. This clearly reflects the descriptivist paradigm that seeks to understand language as it actually occurs, and looks skeptically on attempts to impose "rules" that are often demonstrably wrong. In other words, treating linguistics as an empirical science. The version of this position that Megan argues in the comic is obviously heightened for comic effect (she's also using a sort of mock-Gricean analysis to impute a possible helpful intent to Ponytail).

As it's currently written, the explanation seems to suggest that "I could care less" is the American form and "I couldn't care less" British. In fact, both forms are in use in the US, and it wouldn't surprise me if "I could care less" occurs occasionally in British English as well. There are also other English-speaking countries in the world. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.92.19" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.92.19">162.158.92.19</a> 07:47, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

<p>As for the title text, I'd disagree with "The sentence is also ambiguous, as it may mean that literally or figuratively, the speaker could or couldn't care less." I think that Randall is pretty clear here: he <i>should</i> ('could' as in polite request) care less about irrational idioms instead of wasting time  drawing comics about it. But he just can't resist. And without him doing so, we wouldn't be here. So in fact, it is nonsense for Randall to care less, and this contradiction is the point of the title text joke. But then again, I'm not native English speaker, and even less of a thought reader to understand what was on his mind. -- kavol, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.96.224" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.96.224">141.101.96.224</a> 08:30, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I had an alternate take on the title text. Since I could care less literally means I care some but could stand not to care as much, I took it to mean that for all the comic says about the true spirit and nature of communication and the evils of forcing linguistic absolutism onto other people, at the end of the day Randall still does care about people using correct phraseology. Yes, language is so much more than words and sounds but without clear grammatical usage rules communication could descend into chaos. This is actually one of the pivotal points in Jet Li's movie Hero which is a great commentary on this comic's profundity. The deep resonating pools of meaning that communication stores is only useful for peace and coexistence if we can all understand each other and come together as one. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:R0hrshach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:R0hrshach (page does not exist)">R0hrshach</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:R0hrshach&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:R0hrshach (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:48, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

<p>I think "I could care less" is completely unheard of in Britain - I had to come here to find out what this was all about!  In the UK the correction wouldn't be seen as pedantic, but rather that you had said something really rather odd, possibly for effect.  I'm guessing in the US this doesn't stand out, and the phrase is "familiar" so the brain will run with it, but it just sounds really weird and jarring to me.  That's not being pedantic, we toss double negatives around all over the place.  Randall's point is that it how you interpret the words, rather than exact rules.  So if ponytail is British then she is genuinely just trying to check that it wasn't a slip of the tongue and not meant for effect.  To experience how odd it sounds its like a similar phrase "I don't give a s**t", but someone saying "I do give a s**t" (unless you guy's say that as well?!).  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.205" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.205">141.101.98.205</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.98.205&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.98.205 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd> You're right, the British National Corpus has essentially no hits for "could care less" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/">[3]</a>. However, Ponytail's "correction" doesn't sound like she's unfamiliar with the expression, but more like the common pedantic objection to it, so I doubt that she's intended to be British, or that it's anything other than "showing off how well she knows some mental checklist." The Lawler link above (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/giveadamn.html">[4]</a>) discusses the example "They could give a damn about Whitewater" (as in they <b>don't</b> actually give a damn about it).

</p><p>It's quite amusing as most of the discussion here is about the pedantic usage solely focused on how the listener perceives the expression irregardless (;-p) of what the speaker tried to express, which is is exactly what the comic is ranting about.
If we want to be all pedantic, I'd offer the alternative that "I could care less" is a literally (;-p) perfectly sound form in itself. It's all about expressing the emotional value that someone attaches to a concept or thing -- think of it as an emotional energy or charge. Since everything is inter-dependent, there is no such thing as an absolute zero, it's the relation to other things that matters. The expression "I don't care" would imply the speaker devotes a neutral emotional energy value to the subject. Since it's a relative value, there are no boundaries in either direction and consequently "I could care less" and "I couldn't care less" are perfectly valid. It's all relative, as used to say Frank. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">Ralfoide</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ralfoide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ralfoide (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:28, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

</p><p>"I could care less, but I would have to try" is the phrase as I have always known it (shortened to "I could care less...). I always took this to mean that  someone was indifferent to a thing. It is a bit of an oxymoron since to try would mean you care more when your goal is to care less. My assumption has always been that the way someone feels about something generally exists on a scale from love to hate with the dead center being indifference. To care more from an indifferent standpoint is too move towards one of the poles (love or hate) and thus the oxymoron.--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:The_elusive_pickle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:The elusive pickle (page does not exist)">The elusive pickle</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:The_elusive_pickle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:The elusive pickle (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:27, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Negation by association in French</dt></dl>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/giveadamn.html">assertion</a> that <i>could care less</i>, or <i>give a damn</i>, is "negative in its own right" in the same way as <i>pas</i> in French sounds dubious to me to say the least, if not downright bovine excrement. In French, the original word for negation is <i>ne</i>, it came to be associated with <i>pas</i>, so that there was a perceived redundancy. Dropping <i>ne</i> when <i>pas</i> is used clearly conserves the negative meaning (it is only usual in oral French though, and frowned upon in written French). The same applies with adverbs that have a negative meaning, like <i>jamais</i> (never).

</p><p>Perhaps she's saying she could care a lot about the correction if it's intended to help her, but she could care less than that if the correction stems from the desire to complete a mental checklist.
In other words, there are two interpretations of the significance of Ponytail's correction. If the first interpretation is correct, she will care a lot. If the second interpretation is correct, she will care less. But she's not sure which is the case right now, so she could either care a lot or care less.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.78.10" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.78.10">172.68.78.10</a> 13:53, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

</p><p>The entire explanation seems off, to me... this comic isn't merely about a quirk of English parlance but is an exploration of the state of the human condition and relationships, and the role of communication. Sure, the comic starts off with Ponytail's attempted correction of a common English idiom, and it ends with a call-back to this idiom, but that doesn't mean the comic is all about the idiom. Rather, I think discussing the idiom is the means by which Randall can express his understanding of the role of ALL language and communication in human relationships - to remarkable depth, I would say. He has expressed the sentiment before that "literally the only thing that matters" is how others feel and our relationships with them (in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1216:_Sticks_and_Stones" title="1216: Sticks and Stones">1216: Sticks and Stones</a>, for example, and even as far back as <a href="/wiki/index.php/24:_Godel,_Escher,_Kurt_Halsey" title="24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey">24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey</a>.) This, for him, is the reason effective communication is so important and worth studying - because communication is required for human connection, and human connection has such a profound effect on our psychological well-being. Language pedants, therefore, are missing the point: why get so caught up correcting peoples' grammar, when the whole reason they're talking to you is because they feel alone in a void and they want to feel seen and understood?  If you can understand them just fine, why make it harder for them? Language is more or less arbitrary anyway. The only reason we should correct others' grammar, as Megan implies in the seventh panel, is because you <i>do</i> understand why language exists (that is, to improve our relationships) <i>and</i> because you desire to improve the lives of others by helping them to express themselves more effectively. That is a noble goal; one-upping others is not.
