<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> comments on the fact that as summer approaches, the sun rises earlier and sets later, a common topic of conversation, especially to complain that it is still light at times of day where you are used to it being dark out. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Beret_Guy" title="Beret Guy">Beret Guy</a> comments that he fell off of the wall this morning, a seemingly unconnected topic.
</p><p>People will often complain about falling out of bed as an indicator of having slept badly. The later sunset is often linked to worsened sleep <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.insider.com/why-its-hard-to-sleep-in-the-summer-2018-6">[1]</a>. However, Beret Guy didn't fall from the bed, he fell from the wall. While being able to figure out he's talking about his worsened sleep, Cueball is understandably confused, so Beret Guy clarifies. 
</p><p>Beret Guy is strongly affected by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Great Attractor">Great Attractor</a>, a large gravitational anomaly that influences the galaxies near it, but is difficult to observe directly. Beret Guy claims that the Great Attractor pulls on him unusually hard, which could be another one of his <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Strange_powers_of_Beret_Guy" title="Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy">strange powers</a>. This attraction, while not overpowering the gravity of the Earth, (he states in the title text that he can "Jump extra high" when it is above him) affects his life greatly.
</p><p>For Beret Guy his attraction to the Great Attractor means that, at various times, like now, he can lie on the vertical surface of any wall (external or internal) that is currently oriented in a fortuitous direction (i.e. facing north). He fell off the wall this morning due the Great Attractor being below him during daylight hours and on the horizon during night hours. Thus, Beret Guy's complaint in the first panel comes across as an attempted solidarity with Cueball's complaint; he was still asleep when the Great Attractor moved to below him, causing him to fall off the wall and presumably awaken him. Although the location of the Great Attractor should not be linked directly to daylight here on Earth, it may simply be that Beret Guy's sleep patterns have been disrupted by the later sunset and early sunrise.
</p><p>He gives a short explanation of which Attractor he refers to (the space one) and why the Great Attractor affects him. According to his doctors it is apparently caused by the motion of galaxies and how many dimensions his bones have. Since having fewer than 3 spatial dimensions may lead to trouble, his bones may be existing in more dimensions than our normal 3 dimensions of space and 1 of time. Galactic motions normally have no significant effect on a person with 3-D bones.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>Beret Guy then says that day-sliding season is near, due to the Great Attractor being at the horizon in the day, and offers to run errands for Cueball in the South, implying that he will be pulled towards the south during day-sliding season, and can run much faster in that direction. 
</p><p>Beret Guy is not standing straight up during this comic, he has one knee slightly bent towards Cueball in the first two panels. This is because it is evening (8:00 PM as Cueball states) and the Great Attractor is now coming near the horizon, where it will be during the night. So Beret Guy will be pulled towards the south, behind him in the comic, and thus leans away from the pull. In the final panel, when he leaves Cueball, moving right towards south and into the pull, he can be seen sliding along the ground without walking. He leans a bit back to not stumble forward. His last sentence also indicates that he either speeds up or that he is a little uncertain on his feet altering his voice.
</p><p>He mentions that at the moment during day-time the Great Attractor is beneath him so he can stand straight. He then just feels a little heavier (he will thus weigh more than another person with the same mass). 
</p><p>In the title text he says he liked living in the south because the Great Attractor was often above him, meaning he could jump higher with the help of its pull (and would weigh less than a normal person with same mass). Since he could jump, the force is clearly weaker than Earth's gravity, but still enough for him to easily slide over the ground when it is near the horizon. So he could likely win some high-jump or long-jump competitions if he chose the right time and place.
</p><p>Being Beret Guy, he is never really unhappy, so he states that he also likes it here (in the north). But then he continues to comment on how easy it will be for him to get to the south. Because if he entirely stopped bracing himself against the pull by crouching into a more spherical shape, and just waited for the Great Attractor to get near the horizon again, then the pull would cause him to start rolling over the ground to some place with lower net gravitational potential, i.e. further south, where the Great Attractor will be more directly over his head. 
</p><p>A prior example of an xkcd character with alternate gravitational susceptibility is <a href="/wiki/index.php/417:_The_Man_Who_Fell_Sideways" title="417: The Man Who Fell Sideways">417: The Man Who Fell Sideways</a>, where a consistent off-vertical pull somehow applies (rather than one linked to a spot on the stellar sphere). In <a href="/wiki/index.php/1376:_Jump" title="1376: Jump">1376: Jump</a> Cueball floats sideways across the ground a bit above Earth, in a similar idea to being pulled sideways.
</p><p>See also these other fictional examples of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/872243.The_Revolving_Boy">'personalized'</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Tethys">gravitational</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Sally_Cambric">susceptibilities</a>.
</p><p>Beret Guy has previously been interested in strange attracting forces in the universe, in <a href="/wiki/index.php/502:_Dark_Flow" title="502: Dark Flow">502: Dark Flow</a>, where he hoped it was his mom and wished she would pull on him. It was though not about the Great Attractor, and the force did not clearly affect him, although his love for his mom did affect two space probes, as mentioned in the title text.
</p><p>This comic came out just a bit more than a month before the next comic with one of Beret Guy's strange powers, <a href="/wiki/index.php/2325:_Endorheic_Basin" title="2325: Endorheic Basin">2325: Endorheic Basin</a>. Which is interesting since the previous comic with such a power came back in November 2017, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1922:_Interferometry" title="1922: Interferometry">1922: Interferometry</a>, more than 2.5 years before this one. Also in the Endorheic Basin comic strange forces exerted a pull on Beret Guy, although in that it was he who attracted water, where here it was himself that was most affected.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="More_detail">More detail</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=2310:_Great_Attractor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: More detail">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Some of the humor of the comic has to do with the immense differences in scale between Beret Guy and the Great Attractor.
</p><p>In very round numbers our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Milky Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy is 150,000 - 200,000 light years across.  It is just one of several galaxies in something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Local Group">Local Group</a>, which is around 10,000,000 light years across.  And the Local Group is itself in something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Virgo Supercluster">Local Supercluster</a> (also called the Virgo Supercluster), around 110,000,000 light years across.  Each galaxy, each group, and each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supercluster">supercluster</a> is not just a chance alignment, but is a gravitational coherent structure. And all this is just yet a part of the even larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Laniakea Supercluster">Laniakea Supercluster</a> in which also the Great Attractor is located, along with more than 100,000 other galaxies, in a region of space spanning more than 500 million light years.
</p><p>Something unpredictable (hence "anomalous") is going on with the galaxies in the Local Supercluster (including our own).  These galaxies are indeed accelerating away from one another as seen by their red shift.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_Law" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hubble&#39;s Law">Hubble's Law</a> predicts the expansion should be uniformly proportional to their distance from Earth and from one another.  But for the Local Supercluster something is restricting the expansion.  That something is, as "viewed" from Earth, somewhere in the direction of the Southern Triangle constellation but 250,000,000 light years distant, and has (but only since 1988) been termed the Great Attractor.  The Great Attractor can't conveniently be seen at visible wavelengths, because that direction is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_Avoidance" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Zone of Avoidance">Zone of Avoidance</a>: the area of the night sky obscured by our own Milky Way.
</p><p>Boiling this all down: something a quarter of a billion light years away that makes an anomalous blip in the local rate of expansion of the universe, and whose existence astronomers deduce only by X-ray observations of stellar red-shift, has large-scale effects on everyday gravitational forces uniquely experienced by Beret Guy.  OK, now you can smile.

<dl><dd>I have added <a href="/wiki/index.php/502:_Dark_Flow" title="502: Dark Flow">502: Dark Flow</a> as it has some similarities, but it was not the great attractor in that comic. But also the first I though about.&#160;;-) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 08:22, 25 May 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>It currently says “Beret Guy is not standing straight up [...]. This is presumably due to the extra downwards force that the Great Attractor is currently exerting on him, so he has to exert more effort to hold himself upright and seems quite content”. Am I the only one who thinks this makes no sense? Beret Guy is going to sleep because the Great Attractor starts pulling him sideways. And if there was more force downwards, instead of sidewars, it would not help to bend the knee and stand tilted. If you have to carry heavy things, the easiest way is to put them on your head and stand as much vertical as possible (although this method is unpopular in some countries). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.222" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.222">141.101.98.222</a> 19:31, 23 May 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It's not just you. I interpreted the final frame as him being dragged sideways. This fits with the movement lines along the side covering most of his body, and the "drag lines" left by his feet. His stance makes more sense if he's resisting a sideways force. It also fits better with the time, since the Great Attractor is said to currently be on the horizon at night, and it's 8PM when they are talking. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.75.196" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.75.196">162.158.75.196</a> 21:19, 23 May 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I guess the one who wrote that part of the explanation forgot that it was evening. I have corrected the explanation to indicate that the pull is to the right - i.e. south --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 08:22, 25 May 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Whenever I am standing on a moving Bus or Train, I always bend the knee on my leading leg in order to counteract the inertia trying to force me forwards if the vehicle rapidly slows or stops [adjusting or resisting changes to my center of gravity]. If I tried to lead with a stiff leg I would topple forward. Beret Guy's stance would only work if he intends to slide on his feet. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:These_Are_Not_The_Comments_You_Are_Looking_For" title="User:These Are Not The Comments You Are Looking For">These Are Not The Comments You Are Looking For</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:These_Are_Not_The_Comments_You_Are_Looking_For" title="User talk:These Are Not The Comments You Are Looking For">talk</a>) 04:26, 24 May 2020 (UTC)
</p><p>But why does the Great Attractor pin Berret Guy to the wall, while it won't make him fly?<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Gunterkoenigsmann&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gunterkoenigsmann (page does not exist)">Gunterkoenigsmann</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gunterkoenigsmann&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gunterkoenigsmann (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:07, 24 May 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>There is friction so if it is pulling hard enough the the south he could stay on a wall facing south. But it is also Beret Guy so maybe not think too much. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 08:22, 25 May 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I just changed this, BTW. Obviously a wall with a south-facing side normally also has a north-facing side (if not infilled in some way, or built into a hillside) but it's definitely the latter you'd be reclining against with a southerly attraction in force. Unless I'm confused and you're going to tell me why. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.159.90" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.159.90">162.158.159.90</a> 19:38, 25 May 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I'm pretty sure the local Supercluster is called Laniakea, and Virgo is just a smaller supercluster within it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster</a>

<p>The mysterious analyses of Dark Flow near the great attractor are consistent with Beret Guy's strange experience.  Scientists have said it looks like the universe functions by different laws over there.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.250" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.250">108.162.216.250</a> 23:27, 24 May 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd><i>Although the location of the Great Attractor should not be linked directly to daylight here on Earth.</i>: Literally, no; but like everything else above Luna's orbit, the GA appears to circle the groundpounding observer at about the same rate as Sol. What's really meant by this sentence is obscure.</dd>
<dd><i>But it is also Beret Guy so maybe not think too much.</i>: Absolutely! Is our purpose to explain <b>XKCD</b> or only to lecture science with "just enough" pedantry? If the former, which implies the reader may not count such a rare character as a personal friend, it might be well to drop a word or two about <a href="/wiki/index.php/Beret_Guy" title="Beret Guy">Beret Guy</a>'s fantastic nature.</dd>

<p>This might be a bit of a stretch, but was anyone else reminded of the "Silly Job Interview" sketch from Monty Python at the end?
