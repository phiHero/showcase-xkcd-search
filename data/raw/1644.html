<p>This is the first comic in the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Stargazing" title="Category:Stargazing">Stargazing</a> series. It was followed by <a href="/wiki/index.php/2017:_Stargazing_2" title="2017: Stargazing 2">2017: Stargazing 2</a> two and a half years later and <a href="/wiki/index.php/2274:_Stargazing_3" title="2274: Stargazing 3">2274: Stargazing 3</a> four years later.
</p><p>This comic opens on <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> as the host for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargazing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stargazing">stargazing</a> TV show, or  simply a stargazing tour. She claims to be a doctor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astronomy">astronomy</a> though her remarks, however enthusiastic, may call this into question. (Originally the host was suspected to be a spoof on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Brian Cox (physicist)">Brian Cox</a>, see <a href="#Relevant_TV-shows">below</a>, but at some later point <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> changed his official transcript thus making the host female rather than male as in the original version, see the <a href="#Trivia">trivia</a> section below. Thus now the host is clearly Megan, which it could not have been originally when the host was described as a man by Randall).
</p><p>Throughout the comic the host's tone and choice of words becomes increasingly unprofessional, referring to most of the stars as "shitty," personifying them based on different astronomical observations, and providing little useful information on the study of stars or how they work.
</p><p>It seems that this is not an isolated issue as the television host mentions that people keep asking her whether or not she is a real astronomer.
</p><p>The host also continuously glosses over the arguably less exciting portions of a typical presentation on astronomy sharing only what she sees as "the good stuff." This penchant for only caring about something if it is interesting extends past astronomy as well as the host is too bored when reading the dictionary to look up the meaning of astronomer.
</p><p>The comic derives much of its humor from the absurdity of the host's comments on various astronomical bodies. Although not technically incorrect, the way she presents the information is far from informative. (See details below on <a href="#The_host.27s_observations">the host's observations</a>).
</p><p>One of her observations regards the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sirius">Sirius</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Binary star">binary star</a>, a system where two stars orbit each other. So even though it is the brightest star as seen from Earth we only really see one of them, as the other is, to quote the host, "not even trying". Sirius A is "large" and "bright" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Main sequence">main sequence</a> white star, while Sirius B is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:White dwarf">white dwarf</a> with a little under half the mass, 0.49% the radius and only 0.22% the luminosity of Sirius A.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andromeda Galaxy">Andromeda</a> is the largest galaxy in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Local Group">Local Group</a>. It is 220,000 light years across and contains a trillion stars. Humans have difficulty conceptualizing distances of this scale. Suffice to say that it is very large.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> is the 9th brightest star visible from earth. One of its prominent features is its visible redness. Within the next million years (or maybe only 100,000 years) it is expected to explode as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supernova">supernova</a>, which will certainly be a spectacular sight. It could happen anytime now, and the host hopes it will be in her lifetime.
</p><p>In the title text it is mentioned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sun">Sun</a> is also a star and of course is much brighter than Sirius seen from Earth, and thus Sirius is technically not the brightest star in our sky (although it is in the night sky). The title text sarcastically encourages the audience to raise that obvious but irrelevant point (a standard joke when people mention bright stars) instead of asking a more interesting, informative, or fruitful question, when there are so many to ask regarding astronomy.

<p>Here is a list of the host's observations:
</p>
<ul><li>Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Star_Catalogue" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bright Star Catalogue">visible stars</a> are still very faint, and just become background to the bright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stars">stars</a> that form the named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Constellations">constellations</a>.
<ul><li>The host correctly states that they are just dots. (This is also true for the bright stars, but at least they are clearly distinguishable).</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sirius">Sirius</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apparent magnitude">brightest</a> star in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of brightest stars">night sky</a>. But it is not the brightest object in the night sky, as several of the planets, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Moon">Moon</a> are much brighter. It is also far from being one of the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Absolute magnitude">luminous stars</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, but its proximity to Earth makes it the brightest in the night sky. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_luminous_stars#Data" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of most luminous stars">twenty visible stars</a> that are more luminous than Sirius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_luminous_stars" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:List of most luminous stars">none of which</a> come even close to being in the top 100 of the most luminous stars observed today.
<ul><li>The host thus names Sirius as the star in charge since it outshines all the others as seen from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Earth">Earth</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Sirius is actually a star system consisting of two stars as it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Binary star">binary star</a> system. But where Sirius A is twice the size of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sun">Sun</a> and much brighter, then Sirius B is now just a dim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:White dwarf">white dwarf</a>, the remains from a much larger star that became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Red giant">red giant</a> before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state around 120 million years ago. So now Sirius A completely outshines Sirius B, which actually is now a dead star with no further fusion going on inside its core.
<ul><li>This is construed by the host as it is barely even trying, as it is now only radiating away the rest of the heat from the now exposed core.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andromeda Galaxy">Andromeda</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spiral galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>, like the Milky Way, and it is the largest galaxy in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Local Group">Local Group</a> where our own galaxy the Milky Way is the second largest. It is one of a few visible objects that are located outside the Milky Way. It is "only" 2.5 million light-years from the Sun and it is heading our way (or vice versa), and will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andromeda–Milky Way collision">collide with the Milky way</a> in about 4 billion years (before the Sun goes into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sun">its red giant phase</a>). Being 220,000 light years across and consisting of a trillion stars, it is somewhere between 1.2-2.2 times wider than the Milky Way and has 2.5-10 times as many stars. (The local group was also mentioned two comics ago, in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1642:_Gravitational_Waves" title="1642: Gravitational Waves">1642: Gravitational Waves</a>, together with the much less well known third largest galaxy in the group the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Triangulum Galaxy">Triangulum Galaxy</a>).
<ul><li>It is therefore true when the host says that it is too big to try to understand, and thinking about it will make your head spin, so she suggests we do not think about it.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> is a clearly visible (9th brightest) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_supergiant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Red supergiant">red supergiant</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiregular_variable_star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Semiregular variable star">variable star</a> located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Orion (constellation)">constellation of Orion</a>. It is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars (12th) and one of the few where it is clear that the light is not white. Most people can see that it is slightly red, whereas most other stars are so faint that they look white despite having different colors (when seeing Orion's two brightest stars, to remember which is which between Rigel and Betelgeuse, its diagonal opposite, just remember: Rigel is "R" like blue, and Betelgeuse is "B" like red). It is expected that Betelgeuse, being at a late stage of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stellar evolution">evolution</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse#Approaching_supernova" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Betelgeuse">will go supernova</a> within the next million years as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Type II supernova">type II supernova</a>. The exact time when it will become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Supernova">Supernova</a> is so uncertain that it could <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/betelgeuse-will-explode-someday#explode">just as likely happen tomorrow</a> as in a million years. When it happens it will not be dangerous to anyone on Earth, but it will likely be visible even during the day, as it may even become as bright as the full Moon.
<ul><li>When it does go nova, it will be a fantastic spectacle for everyone, but especially for anyone who likes the <i>good stuff</i> in space like the host, who cannot wait for the star to explode. Clearly she hopes it will be in her lifetime, and, although this is unlikely, there is a small chance that it might just happen.</li></ul></li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Meteor">meteor</a> (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_star" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shooting star">shooting star</a>), is debris from space that rains down on Earth, and burns up in the atmosphere. This happens all the time, but you need to be either lucky, patient, or know the right time for one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_showers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Meteor showers">meteor showers</a> to see one. Often they are visible for so short a time period, that it is difficult to share the experience with anyone, as it will be gone by the time they turn their head to look where you are pointing.
<ul><li>The host becomes very excited when she spots such a meteor, especially because it is likely that her audience got to share the experience with her, as they were already looking in the same direction as her. But still she asks if they saw it, because it is so short lived.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Outer space">Outer space</a> is the void that exists between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astronomical object">celestial bodies</a>, including the Earth.

<p>The comic could be a reference to BBC's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargazing_Live" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stargazing Live">Stargazing Live</a></i>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Brian Cox (physicist)">Brian Cox</a> has appeared in since 2011. If drawn in xkcd style he would likely look like Megan. He has a PhD in high-energy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Particle physics">particle physics</a>, but not astronomy. The newest season of the show aired during January 2016 just a month before this comic's release. Brian Cox has also been the presenter of several other science programs, especially such as the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Solar_System" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wonders of the Solar System">Wonders of the Solar System</a></i>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Universe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wonders of the Universe">Wonders of the Universe</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_Life_(TV_series)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wonders of Life (TV series)">Wonders of Life</a></i>. Originally the host was described as male in the official transcript (see <a href="#Trivia">trivia</a> below, making this seem more likely. for some reason Randall changed the host to female in the transcript later. Very strange, but for sure when he was male, it was obviously a Brian Cox spoof.
</p><p>It could also be a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Horkheimer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jack Horkheimer">Jack Horkheimer</a>'s PBS shows <i>Star Hustler</i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Gazers" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Gazers">Star Gazers</a></i>. Horkheimer, however, does not at all look like Megan, and he died 6 years ago. But he was not a doctor in astronomy, only getting into it when he started volunteering at the Miami Museum of Science's planetarium. He ended up writing shows for the planetarium and the PBS series developed from there. He rarely covered facts about the night sky that couldn't be found in any basic reference (possibly because the show was aimed at children and non-astronomy buffs), although he did get more in-depth about current astronomical events such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Comet Hale–Bopp">Comet Hale–Bopp</a>.

<p>?.. is this Brian Cox??? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.152.155" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.152.155">162.158.152.155</a> 06:07, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Yes I think it is --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:00, 22 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>My first thought was that it was a pisstake of Brian Cox, except I wasn't sure if they had Stargazing Live in America. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.152.143" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.152.143">162.158.152.143</a> 08:33, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> Brian Cox seems like a nice guy and I applaud his enthusiasm, but if you want to see a truly awesome science broadcaster look for a set of broadcasts from the 70s/80s by James Burke titled "The Day the Universe Changed", Mr. Cox's programmes seem to be as much about how many airmiles the production team can accumulate as they are about the science. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.34.147" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.34.147">162.158.34.147</a> 09:10, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd> The airmiles comment above applies to Cox's "Wonders Of The Universe" series, certainly, but my first thought was either that Randall knew of the BBC's semi-regular programme-cluster "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargazing_Live" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Stargazing Live">Stargazing Live</a>", here in the UK, that Cox co-presents - perhaps via BBC America? - or else there's an equivalent US version (precursor or postcursor) of the same name that perhaps has a celebrity-based core team.</dd>
<dd> (Brian's primary co-host in the programme <i>is</i> an Irish comedian, but one with a accredited science background who knows what they're talking about.  They also have 'guest celebrities' for internal and external segments (from just outside the studio, under the night sky, to a pieces filmed/livecast at some space-relevant location, usually featured across all episodes of that season as a theme so not so much 'gratuitous globe-trotting) but they are all <i>interested</i> in space-stuff, and many <i>also</i> have an actual background expertise in physics/astronomy even if that's not what they're publicly known for.)</dd>
<dd> Quickly looking around, I can't see any <i>obvious</i> astronomy programmes(/programs!) in the US that aren't similarly expert-led, but that's possibly because any that are don't feature as 'proper' programmes on any of the lists I've checked. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89">162.158.152.89</a> 14:25, 17 February 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> The title text does imply it is in reference to Brian Cox. He is well known for his very philosophical comments referencing physics in that way. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.70.151" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.70.151">141.101.70.151</a> 20:05, 17 February 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> Hmmm... intentional reference to The Infinite Monkey Cage, with infinite choices of branches, then? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.152.89">162.158.152.89</a> 12:46, 18 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>After the transcript came out two comics later (as now explained in the new trivia section) it is clear that it is not Megan but a male TV host, and thus he almost certainly represents Brian Cox who looks like this (his hair would look just like Megan's in xkcd) and this fits with his way of explaining things. I have changed the entire explanation from Megan and her she, to the host and him he etc. May have overlooked some parts. (Note that Megan is still in the comic in the background of panel 2).  Also the fact that there where new episodes of Stargazing Live last month supports this. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:00, 22 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I also thought this might be poking fun at the "Celebrity" presenters of TV astronomy programs. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.106.173" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.106.173">141.101.106.173</a> 13:16, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I believe the title text may be referring to the fact that several people think that the sun is the brightest star simply because it's the closest to us, completely disregarding absolute magnitude? I'd change the explanation if I knew how. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.245.181" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.245.181">108.162.245.181</a> 06:39, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>The original statement in the comic is about which star is the brightest *in our sky*, i.e. most visible radiation per square meter hitting Earth, not the star with the most total radiation.  You can change the explanation just by hitting the little edit button to the top right of the "Explanation" section.

</p><p>I still don't get the main comic, unless its just situational comedy of someone acting like they know what they are talking about, when really they don't even know the meaning of the word "astronomer". <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.237.91" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.237.91">108.162.237.91</a> 07:01, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I put my best understanding of the comic in the explanation - I'm not sure I really get it, but I figured it was better than nothing. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.237.91" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.237.91">108.162.237.91</a> 07:14, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>This is exactly how I feel about looking at stars and hard core astronomy. I look for the brightest stars, and would like to know something about them, but just the basic facts. I have had a course on astronomy and it was boring to do the math for star formation and cosmology. I learnt that way that I was only interested in the results and conclusions, not in trying to calculate it my self, or counting all the other smaller stars to gain the data needed. I really like Megan here&#160;;-) Space is awesome, astronomy is boring&#160;:-) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 09:08, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I am pretty sure the last line in the first panel used to read "I'm doctor <b>of</b> whatever", but now it's clearly "... doctor <b>or</b> whatever". Has Randall changed the comic? -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.106.11" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.106.11">141.101.106.11</a> 13:06, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I wrote the original transcript based on the comic on this site. This has since been corrected to or, which makes sense. But the image file for the comic has not been changed here on xkcd, so had it not been for your comment here, I would just have put it down to a typo on my behalf. I still think so, as I believed she  said <i>or whatever</i> when I wrote about it in the explanation. But the "or" can look a little as "of". It is, however, not unheard of that Randall changes a comic if he spots a mistake after the first release. This has happened several times. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:50, 17 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>He actually changed the comic, but it was in the third panel with "That's" to "This is Andromeda". This was noted by another user (below this comment which was posted later).

<dl><dd>It's not just you... and from that point of view the title text doesn't read like sarcasm to me.  Perhaps more a reference to choosing branches of science to explore?  Then again, at least one person thought it was sarcastic, and I don't feel strongly enough to change the explanation over it. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.250.161" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.250.161">108.162.250.161</a> 01:35, 18 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm sure it is sarcasm. I wrote it and deleted the first time someone wrote it was not. But at the moment it is back again. It is definitely Randall who thinks it would be a stupid joke. I will not delete it again, but will leave it to others to delete if they agree that this is a clear case of sarcasm, not a way of applauding someone for a brilliant joke!&#160;;-) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:00, 22 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Regarding the Incomplete reasoning: "There may be another joke here. What about the branches in the title text. Is there some well known reference to such a tree. Sound like something with parallel universes and infinite possibilities?"... I must disagree, there's no other joke here. The word "branch" here isn't referring to any tree, but rather the ongoing logical possibilities of a conversation. If you take a video game where you can chose what you say in a conversation (or the choose-your-own-comic xkcd that came out a while ago), and map out all the options, it would look like a "tree", selecting THIS option leads to a new set of options, each of which will lead to ITS own set of options. In the aforementioned comic, selecting "Let me refresh" in the first panel leads to a different set of options for the second panel than if you had selected something else for the first panel. You are now following the "Let me refresh" branch of the conversation. That's all "branch" means in the title, it's referring to the conversation which would result from this, which would "branch off" of such a declaration. - NiceGuy1<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/198.41.235.215" title="Special:Contributions/198.41.235.215">198.41.235.215</a> 06:22, 20 February 2016 (UTC) I finally signed up!

<p>The text in the second panel has changed from 'That's andromeda' to 'This is andromeda'. Just an fyi. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.20" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.20">108.162.216.20</a> 19:26, 20 February 2016 (UTC)

<p>The explanation says all the host's statements are scientifically correct, but in the observations section, there's no defense for "it's in charge," or "barely even trying" being scientifically correct. I'm removing that statement. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.72.191" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.72.191">162.158.72.191</a> 00:37, 25 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>'Andromeda' actually is not the name of the galaxy (which is Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224), but of the constellation that contains it.

<dl><dt>Major Edit Explanation</dt></dl>
<p>Like I said in my previous comment, this needed some major editing. The explanation was disorganized, obtrusive and did little to assist in any understanding of the comic. I condensed important, relevant information and removed unimportant speculations and fixed the general tone of the article. Every word of the comic does not need to be hashed and rehashed only information which is conducive to understanding the comic and the topic of the comic should be included. It is not necessary to include an entire summarized blurb from wikipedia to describe that stars appear small in the night sky or the entire history of the andromeda galaxy. If a visitor does not know that stars look small they are probably not old enough to be reading and if they are interested in andromeda they will follow the wiki link and read about it on their own time. Speculation should be reserved to the talk page and other sections, it should not be included in the comic explanation.<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lackadaisical" title="User:Lackadaisical">Lackadaisical</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lackadaisical" title="User talk:Lackadaisical">talk</a>) 16:42, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Major "return to previous explanation" explanation</dt>
<dd>I completely disagree. Fine that you have made changes, but no need to remove the list. This is standard for explain xkcd that you should be able to find explanation for all items in the comic here. If it is specific like here there will either be a table or a section. If you are not interested in details on the hosts observations you just skip the section or the trivia. I have re-included the section. It is important for the explanation to explain why his observations is accurate/correct if not delivers in a scientifically sound language. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:06, 25 May 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was editing for clarity and tone, perhaps I deleted too much but I think the explanation is much clearer now with both of our edits. Before the "hosts observations" was used to serve as the explanation of his observations rather than to supplement them, now there is a quick discussion of his observations and a detailed insight. More complete, clearer and much nicer. Thank you for your review. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lackadaisical" title="User:Lackadaisical">Lackadaisical</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lackadaisical" title="User talk:Lackadaisical">talk</a>) 13:56, 25 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Is it even possible to view all of the things that the host mentions from a single point on Earth?  Andromeda is in the southern hemisphere, while Sirius is at the north pole.
</p><p>I'm not an expert astronomer or star gazer, so I don't know.
</p><p>Edit: Oopsie.  I seem to have deleted all the previous comments.  Sorry. &#160;:(

</p>
<dl><dd>Well not that much expert&#160;;-) If you look at the wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Andromeda (constellation)">Andromeda (constellation)</a> you will find that it is indeed in the northern part of the sky, as are Sirius and Betelgueze (in winter at least). I actually tried to spot Andromeda after this comic came out, but it was not really possible from my garden too close to a larger city (at least at the time of night I tried). But it is rather close to cassiopeia which is even closer to the northern star. So yes all of these three items would be clearly visible at the time of year the comic was releases in the area where the author lives i the US or from the UK where the program he spoofs is made. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 07:19, 26 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
