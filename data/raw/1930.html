<td> The time of year at which the apparent position of the overhead sun passes the equator. During the equinox, the time that the Sun is above the horizon is 12 hours across the globe.
</td>
<td> Before the adoption of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> in 1582, the equinoxes fell on earlier and earlier dates as the centuries went by, due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Julian calendar">Julian calendar</a> year being 365.25 days on average compared to the tropical Earth year of 365.2422 days. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pope Gregory">Pope Gregory</a>'s decision to remove the leap days on years that were multiples of 100 but not 400 corrected the average length of the calendar year to 365.2425 days.

</td>
<td> The time of year when the apparent position of the overhead sun reaches its most extreme latitude. During the Winter and Summer solstices the days are the shortest and longest respectively.
</td>
<td> Similar to the equinoxes, the solstices were also falling on earlier dates every year before the Gregorian calendar.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The [Winter/Summer] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Olympics">Olympics</a>
</td>
<td> The Olympic Games occur during the summer and the winter, alternating between the two seasons every two years.
</td>
<td> The Olympic Games do not have any set dates, and seem to only be included humorously as something else that alternates between occurring during the summer and winter.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> The [latest/earliest] [sunset/sunrise]
</td>
<td> The extremes of times that the sun crosses a horizon according to a clock that keeps a fixed 24 hours as opposed to varying with the sun like a sundial.
</td>
<td> The latest sunset and earliest sunrise occur around the summer solstice; the latest sunrise and earliest sunset occur around the winter solstice. They do not occur exactly on these dates due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Equation of time">equation of time</a> causing drift in the times that sunsets and sunrises occur.

<td> Daylight [saving/savings] time
</td>
<td> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Daylight saving time">Daylight saving time</a>, commonly referred to as daylight savings time, is the practice of setting clocks ahead, typically by one hour, during the summer months of the year.
</td>
<td> Daylight saving time will push the time of certain events such as sunrise and sunset past their "natural" times. For example, solar noon will occur around 1:00 PM instead of 12:00 noon when daylight saving time is active, making it the "wrong" time.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Leap [day/year]
</td>
<td> Because the durations of celestial events are not generally nice multiples of each other, they will tend to fall out of sync with each other. Leap days are days inserted into specific years to bring the calendar back into sync, and the years on which these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_day" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Leap day">leap days</a> occur are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Leap year">leap years</a>.

It is defined as the Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. This complicated formula has a long tradition behind it, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computus">Computus</a>.
</td>

</td>
<td> Each of these lunar events happens approximately once a year.
<ul><li> The harvest moon appears exactly once because it has a particular definition based on the time of year.</li>
<li> The cycle of the distance of the full moon lasts about 13.5 months (14 full moons). However, because a supermoon is defined as any full moon that is within 10 percent of the closest relative distance possible (with 0 being perigee and 1 being apogee), it happens multiple times a cycle, for a total of usually 3 to 4 times per year.</li>
<li> The blood moon during a lunar eclipse appears between zero to two times a year. The hunter's moon appears exactly once like the harvest moon.</li></ul>

<td colspan="2"> The Sun and Moon are generally what calendars are based on. If something were to drift out of sync, some corrective mechanism would have to be put in to put it back. This is the motivation behind leap years, leap months (in countries with lunisolar calendars) and leap seconds.

<td> drifts out of sync with the zodiac
</td>
<td colspan="2"> The dates on which the Sun crosses the constellations in the traditional zodiac has shifted in the past centuries due to the precession of the Earth's axis.

<ul><li> The state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arizona">Arizona</a> generally does not observe daylight saving time, keeping their clocks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC-7:00" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:UTC-7:00">UTC-7:00</a> Mountain Standard Time year round. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_nation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Navajo nation">Navajo nation</a> reservation inside Arizona does observe it, causing the two regions to have different times in the summer and the same time in the winter.</li>
<li> Time zones in Russia are all one hour ahead of what their longitude would suggest, which puts them in a "permanent" state of daylight saving time. (For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> is 30°E, which means that its natural time zone is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B2:00" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:UTC+2:00">UTC+2:00</a>, but its time zone is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B3:00" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:UTC+3:00">UTC+3:00</a>.) From 1981 until 2011 Russia used to have the daylight saving time on top of it as well. The other changes include the abolition of the one-hour shift in 1991 and a return it back in 1992, and an increase to two hours in 2011 and a restoration back to one hour in 2014.</li>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Indiana">Indiana</a> has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Time in Indiana">a complicated history</a> with daylight saving time, likely related to the state being split between two time zones.</li></ul>

<td colspan="2"> Time zone reform is surprisingly a very controversial and politicized issue, with special interests on either side looking to modify it to fit their needs. Examples of proposals to modify the scheme include:
<ul><li> Extend the duration of daylight saving time by one month, which was done in 2007 in many states as part of an energy-saving proposal by George W. Bush.</li>
<li> Reduce the duration of daylight saving time back to its original span, or further.</li>
<li> Eliminate daylight saving time altogether, going back to using standard time.</li>
<li> Abolish daylight saving time but advance the time zone by one hour, effectively instating daylight saving time year round. This was done during World War II, and is also done in certain areas of Canada like Saskatchewan (which from 1966 onwards has observed Central Standard Time despite the entire province being squarely in the Mountain longitudes).</li>
<li> Abolish daylight saving time and advance the time zone by 30 minutes, splitting the difference between the current standard time and daylight saving time.</li>
<li> Abolish daylight saving time, but make government offices open one hour earlier in the summer, encouraging private businesses to do the same. This was done by Warren G. Harding in 1922 because he felt that changing the clocks was a "deception", but was rolled back the next year as it caused mass chaos in terms of what businesses decided to do to adapt to the change in business hours.</li>
<li> Reduce the number of time zones in the United States to two, consolidating Pacific time into Mountain time (UTC-7:00), and Eastern time into Central time (UTC-6:00). This was proposed in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://qz.com/142199/the-us-needs-to-retire-daylight-savings-and-just-have-two-time-zones-one-hour-apart/">2013 article in Quartz</a> by Allison Schrager.</li></ul>
<p>At best, these time zone proposals will be fraught with controversy, with both sides arguing for the benefits of their time system. Some proposals, such as the 30-minute and 20-minute suggestions, would put the minute hands of the entire United States out of sync with the rest of the world, defeating the purpose of time zones with hourly UTC offsets in the first place, which could be construed as "making things worse".

</p><p>The only change I made was to "precession", "libration", etc by adding the word "the" in front because it reads better. At least to my British English sensibilities. YLMV.

<dl><dt>Equinox</dt></dl>
<p>I don't think this is the correct definition for equinox, the plane comprising the Earth orbit around the Sun is never perpendicular to the Earth's axis. During the equinox the sun rays arrive to the Earth perpendicular to the equator line, this would be better. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.62.238" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.62.238">172.68.62.238</a> 22:10, 18 December 2017 (UTC)CBM
</p>
<dl><dd>I agree with the comment above; the Earth's axis is always tilted 23 degrees from the plane of the orbit. There are times the North pole is tilted toward the Sun and times it is tilted away from the Sun. Twice a year (at the equinoxes) the tilt is perpendicular to the Sun. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.239" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.239">108.162.221.239</a> 22:47, 18 December 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I've edited the descriptions - do they look better now? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.126.28" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.126.28">162.158.126.28</a> 00:32, 19 December 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Daylight Saving Time</dt></dl>
<p>Twice the description references locations that don't follow the common DST plan as 'other than the natural latitude would suggest'. The <i>longitude</i> would suggest a time zone, not the latitude. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.239" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.239">108.162.221.239</a> 22:47, 18 December 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Arbitrary decision by Benjamin Franklin</dt></dl>
<p>The electric charge on an electron is conventionally described as being negative. I was always taught that this was because of a more or less arbitrary decision made by Franklin. I suspect Mr Munroe is humorously conflating this with Franklin's connection to Daylight Saving Time.

<p>My personal favorite: “Did you know that Toyota Truck Month happens at the wrong time every year because of a decree by the pope in the 1500s? Apparently it’s getting worse and no one knows why. While it may seem like trivia, it is now recognized as a major cause of World War 1. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">PotatoGod</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:PotatoGod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:PotatoGod (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:06, 19 December 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Did you know that the Blood Moon might happen twice this year because of a decree by the pope in the 1500s? Apparently there's a proposal to fix it, but it actually makes things worse. While it may seem like trivia, it is now recognized as a major cause of World War 1.

Got this from the link to the fact generator, and I like that too, maybe because it is close to the one above, which I first saw now:

</p><p>Is no one going to mention that "Shark Week" sometimes is used as slang to refer to menstruation? That's what I thought of the moment I saw it, and since cycles are roughly every 28 days but can change length slowly to re-synchronize (with others or for various reasons) that might be another valid interpretation. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.22.86" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.22.86">172.69.22.86</a> 20:14, 31 December 2017 (UTC)Rowan

What's incomplete in this explanation? Seems pretty exhaustive to me. Can't we remove the incomplete tag? Zetfr 15:09, 2 May 2018 (UTC)
</p><p>The explanation says the comic generates facts. But as most of them are false it should refer to them as factoids. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.38.8" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.38.8">162.158.38.8</a> 11:19, 18 February 2020 (UTC)
