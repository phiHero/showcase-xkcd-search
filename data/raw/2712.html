<p>This interactive comic promotes Randall's new book <a href="/wiki/index.php/What_If%3F_2" title="What If? 2">What If? 2</a>, which was released in September and is available for purchase. You pilot a small spaceship throughout a vast area in space exploring various bodies and planets within the play area, many containing easter eggs alluding to the book What If? 2 and previous xkcd comics. The flight mechanics are Newtonian so the spaceship can use the gravity of planets to alter its trajectory or enter orbit. The spaceship has indicator circles around it which appear when a gravitational body comes into range, showing the direction towards their center of gravity and the size of the body. A circle also appears around the spaceship whenever it collides with a gravitational body, acting as a shield. The shield remains until the player orients the spaceship upright so its landing gear can deploy.
</p><p>You can easily fly between planets if you pay attention to orbital mechanics: don't just floor the accelerator. The background stars show your velocity and orientation relative to the nearest gravity well.  If you are having difficulties navigating space, point towards a gravity orb and accelerate for only a few seconds. Wait until the background stars spin wildly, and then reduce your velocity to 0 before gently accelerating towards the object.
</p><p>With a keyboard the arrow keys rotate the spaceship and accelerate it forward and backward. You can also use the standard first-person shooter keys 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd', and the standard vi text editor navigation keys 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' to control the spaceship. Despite some spaceships having no unique backward texture, they can all reverse. On mobile the comic will full screen, pressing either side of the center rotates the spaceship, and pressing in the center accelerates it forward. Various additional glitches may occur if you're playing on mobile. Having a starting position slightly below the take-off pad means you're already 'glitched' inside the planet from the off. Escaping the planet may need inverted 'accelerating' (turning perpendicular to the local vertical and thrusting backwards until you can glitch back out into more open space. You may also be trapped within the cannonball 'orbit', with seemingly inconsistent collision-detection, such that you can be sat <i>with landing gear extended</i> upon features (projectile tracks, etc) that seem not to count as solid for most other purposes.
</p><p>There is no "universal" point of view — the bottom of the window, "down", is oriented towards the object exerting the most gravity upon the player. Multiple things found in this comic draw attention to this, such as how on Earth Ponytail says to White Hat, "I checked downforeveryoneorjustme.com and it says just me", and he replies "Yeah, I guess down isn't down for everyone." Throughout the play area are coins that change the spaceship into different rockets and non-space-based vehicles.

<p>The objects in the mini universe of this browser game are all at fixed positions and do not interact through gravity, however, the ship controlled by the player is affected by gravity. While this makes it technically a relatively easy integration problem (of the position of the player ship forward in time), the integrator used seems to be a relatively simple one, but certainly not a simplistic one, because it does not conserve angular momentum. This can be seen when one manages to get into orbit around some object, e.g., the core of the sun. The orbit slowly decays over time.
</p><p>The logic for extending the landing legs and landing is rather simple. A ship can (normally) land if it is facing away from the surface it collides with, and if its momentum is more-or-less directed towards the surface. Once landing is triggered, the ship will rotate to face directly away from the object exerting the most gravity on the player, regardless of how sloped the surface is. The only way to get into space again is to accelerate forwards, as neither turning nor accelerating backwards cancels the landed state. All of this can be abused to land on almost everything. To land on the underside of an object, simply point your ship away from the object and slowly accelerate backwards to counteract the force of gravity. Landing on the side of an object is more difficult, as ships cannot accelerate sideways. The first method is to accelerate backwards to launch yourself upwards and towards the object so that at the top of your arc you will collide with the object. Then, rotate your ship accordingly to land. Method two is to just repeatedly slam your back of your ship into the object until you land. Note that with any of these weird landing methods, your ship will turn to face away from the source of gravity and can clip into objects.
</p><p>Executing <code>window.python("import antigravity")</code> or <code>python("import antigravity")</code> as Javascript on the page will reverse gravity, multiplying the gravity constant by -1.

Found another planet (has a reference to the "Tires" chapter in How To) with a cannonball, which turned me into an astronaut.

</p><p>Rough summary: The comic is an interactive space flight game, starting landed on an origin planet. The planet is static, and the player starts in a ship controlled by WASD or Directional keys. The ship can go up and down, and rotate left and right. Game simulates orbits and gravity, making navigation tricky. Around the player ship there are dots which indicate nearby planets - there are numurous planets, each with what seem to be drawings related to the What If book. Within the browser, planets are loaded in PNG format by chunk, names formatted as "planet_0_0" with numbers incrementing as grid co-ordinates. Planets and objects found: "origin" "europa", "road", "b612". NOTE: Several hazards exist, such as a field of black holes - if flown into, the ship can become stuck if let to be pulled close to the surface, locking in place. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230">172.70.110.230</a> 23:13, 16 December 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> Within browser dev console exists the objects "Ship" and "Comic", the latter containing a list of all objects and coordinates, as well as various setting for the game physics and settings. Comic contains the sub-object "Voyager", which contains the details and settings for the player ship, including location, speed, etc. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230">172.70.110.230</a> 23:13, 16 December 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> There are 5 ship types in the game code, each with their own consumable transformative found in the world. The ship alternatives are (ship1, ship2, ship-tintin, ship-figure, ship-soccerball). These can be changed with console command [Comic.ship = "ship1"]. Note: At current, "ship-soccerball" returns an error and does not load correctly. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.110.230">172.70.110.230</a> 23:13, 16 December 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> The "ship.shields" is a boolean value that defaults to true, and when set to false, makes the game behave in a lunar lander mode (bad landing black screens the whole page). The "ship.engine" types I see in the code are "warp" (very fast speeds) and "infinite improbability drive" (teleports to 'improbable' places). Default engine is "standard", but it seems any value that is not the former two has the same effect. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.254.165" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.254.165">172.70.254.165</a> 23:32, 16 December 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> In addition to Europa, the space road, and B-612, there is the "Edge of the Universe" (complete with Milliways restaurant nearby), a... tree (which is extremely hard to land on), a planet populated by the characters from Dinosaur Comics (and the main cast of Jurassic Park), the USS Enterprice (NCC 1701-C), and likely quite a bit more. Orbital mechanics make it tough to land on the smaller targets. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.71.254.46" title="Special:Contributions/172.71.254.46">172.71.254.46</a> 23:07, 16 December 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Plus what appears to be Earth, complete with the LHC. There's a 2nd "cannonball" there for an additional ship upgrade, but at the time I found it, that graphic was unavailable. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.126.232" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.126.232">172.70.126.232</a> 23:15, 16 December 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> "Edge of the Universe" is part of "Outside". There is a hidden tunnel from the main universe to the bubble universe at coordinates (7597,24327) point nose of ship at words "EDGE OF THE" and fire thrusters. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.79.160" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.79.160">162.158.79.160</a> 03:59, 17 December 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I went out a long ways away, and eventually found The Great Attractor.  It attracts really hard.  I couldn't leave the surface.  (I wasn't able to leave the center of Europa either, though, so, not saying much.)  There are also some terrifying black holes (a binary system?), though something's weird about their gravity; you kinda bounce off of them a quarter screen away or so? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.77" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.77">108.162.216.77</a> 23:10, 16 December 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd> I *think* thats a wormhole, you go in one and then out the other. I got stuck right between them. Speaking of getting stuck, there is a bug where if you hit a planet with enough gravity fast enough, the ship is inside the planet. Holding W makes you go backwards (or at least towards the center maybe?) and you can get all the way to the other end of the planet where you slow down a lot, but can eventually leave. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.82.166" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.82.166">172.70.82.166</a> 23:19, 16 December 2022 (UTC)Bumpf</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There's one planet that's supposed to be the "remnant of the sun", is that what you mean with The Great Attractor? (It has a bridge on it with a coin(?) blocking part of the way, and a space ship actively crashing into its surface, drawn as several frames.) You can leave that by skidding over the surface like a skipping stone to gather momentum - it's tricky, due to various obstacles, but possible! (It's possible you need two ship power-ups?! If they're indeed power-ups and not just aesthetic changes, I didn't pay attention.)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Using a tablet (no keyboard, but seems to respond to touch), controls are confusing. Presuming that touching bottom left activates left-rotate and touching bottom right does right-rotate (can't see the presumably white-lije controls over the white planet) but I can't get <i>thrust</i> anything but 'reverse' into the planet centre. No obvious top-edge hotspots, either. Maybe I need to do a "You will not go to space today" and then reverse <i>upward</i>...

</p><p>Alright, fixed. A few things I'm thinking about to do next, but I don't have time for:
1. Add gravitation attractions in a new column. They're all in the json dump, I suggest using a json viewer for more convenience. Or doing some coding?
2. Add item locations. This one is important, as items are a major feature.
3. Organize the items, either by alphabetical, or by distance from Earth. This might be hard...
4. Get details in! We need more information. This is the most important by far, get to work! haha.

</p><p>I'm was adding the "Y" tags for the different bodies, do we want to add a "Y" if there is any of that reference on the planet (for the planet row in the chart) or only add the Y on the specific comic fragments or POIs on the planet? On the one hand it seems like it would be helpful to see what kind of references are on a planet overall, but I also feel that it could quickly turn into every planet having every single box checked. Also, I feel we need a 2nd box for what if 1 vs what if 2, as well as TE and HT. I haven't explored the map very much yet, but if there are a lot of ST/SW/LR references they may need to be separated from movies, similar to the abbreviation system on hoverboard. I don't edit a lot and I have only edited "new" pages once or twice so if anyone has any advice or issues with what I have added feel free to add your opinions here. Thanks!

</p><p>Instead of there being a wide "references" column with 4 sub-columns, I think it should be just a "references" column with what the reference is as the text, instead of it being a boolean.

</p><p>There is a planet at {x: 34704, y: -25501} with a space elevator attached to it. In that same planet, at {x: 31682, y: -34551}, there's a guy complaining about the framerate being "really bad out today"; the screen will stutter if you fly by him.

<p>Maybe I'm crazy, but is it possible that the positions of some objects have been changed since the comic was posted? The other day, if I flew straight up from the starting point never disabling the engine, I'd get flung around by some gravity wells before being flung out in a direction that would, eventually, lead me right past the 'light mode' button. Today, however, I always end up crashing into the USS Enterprise, and to add to the weirdness, I don't even hit it at the same angle every time. Also, I hope I'm signing this right, it's my first post. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:SitkaFox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:SitkaFox (page does not exist)">SitkaFox</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:SitkaFox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:SitkaFox (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:45, 17 December 2022 (UTC)

<p>Is the cluster of black holes, labeled "maw", possibly related to the Maw Cluster in Star Wars?<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nedlum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nedlum (page does not exist)">Nedlum</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nedlum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nedlum (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:00, 19 December 2022 (UTC)
</p><p>In the cluster of the black holes there is a small white planet about the size of the spaceship, which does not appear to show any gravity. It can be found at [-60050, 16150]. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.246.211" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.246.211">172.70.246.211</a> 20:27, 19 December 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dt> Is the universe infinite</dt></dl>
<p>Space is big. Really, really big. But it's not infinite. Or is it? If you transport to positive coordinates &gt; ~1000001019, the starfield freezes and becomes blurred. However, you still have momentum/can manouevre, and once you reach acceptable coordinates again it unfreezes. If you transport to negative coordinates &lt; ~-2900000000000000000, the starfield looks fine, but you're frozen in place. Firing your rockets will only move you a short hop before you freeze again, until you manage to hop close enough to acceptable coordinates. It turns out physics is not the same everywhere in the universe after all...<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.175" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.175">172.70.85.175</a> 12:26, 21 December 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That sounds like fairly normal (modern) browser behaviour for 'loose' image objects on a web-page/similar. All controls so far mentioned are via keyboard, and no sign that mouse-control has been implemented in any way. Try cursors/wasd/hjkl (perhaps after a click to 'focus' on the dynamic image?) and it <i>should</i> work, or at least after a fashion. 13:31, 22 December 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I eventually worked out that I needed to use the arrow keys, but all I got was a few passing dots that I couldn't interact with, and a lot of time where all there was just the rocket and black space, so I had no way of telling if the rocket was moving or not. No sign of the stuff other people have mentioned here. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.170.228" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.170.228">162.158.170.228</a> 08:51, 23 December 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's not guaranteed to work with every browser/platform, and you might just have it unlucky (I can only get it to work on my tablet's Chrome (not the also present Firefox) and it has crashes/oddities that might be resource limits being reached on such a relatively low-powered device. For desktop, I don't use Chrome at all (and I don't have Edge/etc, either), and it really doesn't like my Firefox setup, but that might be my long-standing settings/etc (for historical compatability) rather than innate inability.</dd>
<dd>For all I know, you're hitting similar roadblocks to (<i>some</i> places for).me. Or perhaps you've just not found the 'touch' (which l, for my tablet/Chrome use, I had to learn and develop to get some sensible 'play' out of it) and so your trans-orbital slingshots are not giving you the chance to convert into any sort of slow-flyby or landing situation.

<dl><dt> Browser must have access to canvas</dt></dl>
<p>In case anyone can't fly the ship at all, the game requires browser to access the canvas, or your ship will be constantly "shielded" and unable to move more than a pixel or two at a time. Privacy-based browsers or those with fingerprint defender add-ons block canvas access or will report fake canvas values, so they must be disabled.
