<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States presidential line of succession">United States presidential line of succession</a> is the order of people who serve as president if the current incumbent president is incapacitated, dies, resigns, or is removed from office.  
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act#Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1947" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Presidential Succession Act">Presidential Succession Act of 1947</a> revised the presidential order of succession to its current order. This Act, though never challenged in the courts, may not be constitutional for two reasons. First, the Act names two members of Congress as successors.  There are serious questions as to whether this violates the principle of Separation of Powers. The second issue is that the Act allows for anyone skipped over for succession to later assume the office if circumstances change to allow them to hold it. This would mean that the person in question could effectively unseat a sitting President, which raises serious constitutional issues. 
</p><p>There are also practical concerns regarding the Act. The line of succession includes all members of the Cabinet in the order that their department was established, with the oldest departments first. No consideration is given to which departments would be most relevant to the Presidency, particularly considering that this type of succession would presumably involve a serious crisis, which the new president would need to be able to address immediately. The Department of Homeland Security is in charge of the security and protection of the United States and its citizens and would probably already be privy to sensitive intelligence and briefings related to national security, but because it is the latest of the Departments to have been established (in 2003), the Secretary of Homeland Security is last in the current Presidential line of succession, behind Secretaries in much less sensitive roles, such as those of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Education.
</p><p>Another concern is that, by including members of Congress immediately after the Vice President, there is a serious risk that the simultaneous death of the President and Vice President could cause the Presidency to change to the opposing party, which could lead to serious political instability at the precise moment when the country is facing a national crisis. It even presents the possibility that simultaneous assassinations of the President and Vice President could function as an effective coup, shifting power to their opponents. 
</p><p>Finally, there is the issue that, usually, everyone in the line of succession lives and works in Washington D.C. Hence, a sufficiently destructive attack or natural disaster impacting the city could realistically incapacitate all of them, leaving the USA leaderless at a time of extreme crisis. It is already established practice in the USA that everyone in this line not gather together at once. In cases where most senior government officials gather (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:State of the Union"> State of the Union</a>), at least one member of the line of succession (referred to as the "designated survivor") is secured off-site, and would assume the presidency in the unlikely event that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_casualty_event" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mass casualty event"> mass casualty event</a> were to kill or incapacitate everyone else in the line. However, disasters impacting an entire city remain a possibility, and no provision is made for them in current law.
</p><p>To correct these issues, a think tank known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_Government_Commission" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Continuity of Government Commission"> Continuity of Government Commission</a> prepared a report recommending a new line of succession, which would not include members of Congress, would reorder the cabinet secretaries so that the most suitable roles would be the first successors, and would include people who do not live or work in Washington DC.  The full text of their report can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06_continuity_of_government.pdf">here</a>. A short, readable summary, including the report's recommended new line of succession, is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-continuity-of-the-presidency-the-second-report-of-the-continuity-of-government-commission">here</a>. 
</p><p>The first six members of the commission's list are taken from the current line of succession, though the order is changed; they propose that after this, five new people should be appointed specifically for the purpose of assuming the presidency, if needed. Randall's list begins with these eleven people (combining the five new appointees into #7); afterwards, his list becomes increasingly comical and ridiculous.
</p><p>Randall's list omits members of Congress, as well as other cabinet positions, in accordance with the report's concerns about constitutionality and qualifications. However, his other additions totally ignore these issues, including people with no apparent qualifications for the office (such as actors, athletes, and competitive eaters) and people who are constitutionally ineligible for the office.  The US Constitution requires that the President of the United States must be a natural-born US citizen, at least 35 years of age, and have resided in the US for at least fourteen years. Randall's list includes many people who don't meet these requirements.  Most notably, he includes the entire succession to the British crown, almost none of whom meet the requirement of being natural-born citizens of the United States.
</p><p>It may be expected that many of the athletes, musicians and actors on this list are likely to be ineligible as well. Most professional athletes in the relevant sports are under 35 years old, particularly those at the peak of their careers (when they'd likely win MVP awards), the most popular musicians also tend to be younger than 35, and many who meet these requirements were not born US citizens (and some many not even reside in the US).  However, the existing line of succession can also contain ineligible people, who would simply be skipped over for succession. For example, at the comic's publication, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Chao" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Elaine Chao">Elaine Chao</a> was the Secretary of Transportation and would normally be 14th in line, but because she is a naturalized citizen of the US, rather than native-born (she was born in Taiwan) she would not qualify for the office if the line came to her.
</p><p>The title text mentions that ties will be broken by whoever was closest to the surface of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Europa">Europa</a> when they were born. Europa is a moon of Jupiter and one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitability_of_natural_satellites" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Habitability of natural satellites">potential habitability</a>. This is likely a parody of systems in which ties are broken by semi-arbitrary rules (such as the older candidate automatically winning a tie) or a randomized ones (such as ties being decided by a coin flip).  The position of Europa with respect to Earth at the time of one's birth depends on enough factors that it acts as a pseudo-random tie breaker, albeit a needlessly complicated one.

If the three preceding officials were simultaneously killed or incapacitated, there would be a high likelihood that the country was either under attack, and other powers could easily try to take advantage of any power vacuum. Since the Secretary of Defense is most connected to the nation's military, and most in tune with information regarding potential threats and risks, this would be a logical succession.

Presumably this provision covers the case where much of the government, including positions 1–6 here, are killed by a natural disaster or attack in Washington, D.C.
<p>This suggestion establishes no qualifications for these people, but the fact that they'd need to be confirmed by the Senate suggests that they would be chosen to be competent for the role. It is also unclear if an order is determined among these five or if they take up a joint presidency. This suggestion is taken from the Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission to prevent the danger of the entire line of succession being removed in a single event.

It should also be noticed that Tom Hanks played Jim Lovell, who served in the navy before becoming an astronaut (Many early astronauts were former military members.), in <i>Apollo 13</i>, a military captain in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, a prison officer in <i>The Green Mile</i>, a naval intelligence officer in <i>James B.

<p>Obviously, the joke is that changing the order of the words from the previous proposal produces something that could actually exist.

However, it is possible that someone in the line of succession to the British throne either is a dual citizen or is not British (a person from outside of Britain or Ireland can become King; for example, some, including George I, were from what is now Germany).
<p>The first 59 names on the list are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_British_throne#Current_line_of_succession" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Succession to the British throne">here</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/?date=2018-06-06">British Line of Succession on 6 June 2018</a> shows the list as it was at the comic's publication.

As with Mark Foale, though, whether that qualifies as natural-born has not be tested (leaving aside his age and the fact that many royals in his position have historically relinquished their birthright US citizenship voluntarily, which he may choose to do once he reaches age 16). In theory, the full British succession list includes <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wargs.com/essays/succession/2011.html">several thousand people</a> (living descendants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sophia of Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a> who are not Roman Catholic or otherwise disqualified), and it is possible that one or more such people would also be eligible to be President of the United States beyond Master Archie. 
</p><p>The humor here derives from the fact that the United States was established by declaring independence from the United Kingdom, with rejection of the British monarchy being a basic founding principle, and a core principle of US governance. To appoint the British monarchy to the American presidency would contradict the basic goals of American independence.

<dl><dd> A proposal for a new presidential line of succession</dd>
<dd> Current politics aside, most experts agree the existing process is flawed. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 is probably unconstitutional on several counts, and there are many practical issues with the system as well.</dd>
<dd> <span style="color:gray">(For more, see the surprisingly gripping <i>Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission</i>, June 2009.)</span></dd>
<dd> Proposed line of succession:
<ol><li> President</li>
<li> Vice president</li>
<li> Secretary of State</li>
<li> Secretary of Defense</li>
<li> Secretary of Homeland Security</li>
<li> Attorney General</li>
<li> Five people who do not live in Washington DC, nominated at the start of the president's term and confirmed by the Senate</li>
<li> Tom Hanks</li>
<li> State Governors, in descending order of state population at last census</li>
<li> Anyone who won an Oscar for playing a governor</li>
<li> Anyone who won a Governor's award for playing someone named Oscar</li>
<li> Kate McKinnon, if available</li>
<li> Billboard year-end Hot 100 singles artists #1 through #10 (for groups, whoever is credited first in name, liner notes, etc)</li>
<li> The top 5 US astronauts in descending order of total spaceflight time</li>
<li> Serena Williams (or, if she lost her most recent match, whoever beat her)</li>
<li> The most recent season NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL MVPs</li>
<li> Bull Pullman and his descendants by absolute primogeniture</li>
<li> The entire line of succession to the British throne</li>
<li> The current champion of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest</li>
<li> All other US citizens, chosen by a 29-round single-elimination Jousting tournament</li></ol></dd></dl>

<p>Academy awards have been won by actors playing kings / queens - of England, the United Kingdom and Siam - Princes - of Denmark - and Prime Ministers of Great Britain and even the President of the Uniter States / Member of the house of Representatives, but I do not believe it has been won by an actor playing a state govenor. Mind you it is not clear if an actor playing a prison govenor,  would count. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Arachrah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arachrah (page does not exist)">Arachrah</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Arachrah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Arachrah (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:30, 6 June 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>There is actually legal question about whether someone born on foreign soil to US citizens count as "natural-born" (or whether courts would just say it's a political question and pass the buck to Congress), though I will add Foale back to the list. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.62.207" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.62.207">162.158.62.207</a> 14:04, 7 June 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The non-US-citizen-being-in-line-for-the-Presidency thing has already been cleared up IRL - several Presidential cabinets have had non-natural-born-US citizens on them (current Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was born in Taiwan; in the past Madeline Albright was born in the then-Czechoslovakia).

<dl><dd>Presidential elections are mandated in the Constitution every four years - Bill or any of his descendants, or any qualifying member of the UK royal line of succession, would only serve until the current term ends.

<p>There are two problems with this explanation:
The line of succession applies only when the office of president becomes vacant. If the president is incapacitated, the vice president acts as president. If that office is vacant, or the vice precident is also incapacitated, the US will have to do without a president.
</p><p>The constitution places no restrictions on who can act as president. The current law of succession stipulates that only those elegible to become president can act as president, the constitution does not.

</p>
<dl><dd>Point 1, the office of President may be vacant but the powers of the Acting President execute the same by whomever the line falls to, and in times of crisis people will nearly certainly just consider them the new President (conflicting claims aside). Point 2 is just false - Article 2 of the Constitution stipulates natural-born citizen at 35 years old and having lived in the US for the last 14 years. Unless you're arguing that "President" and "Acting President" aren't the same? That sure as hell didn't stop John Tyler from refusing to acknowledge anyone who didn't acknowledge him as the new President after William Henry Harrison died a month into his term.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.52.139" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.52.139">173.245.52.139</a> 15:17, 11 June 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Point2: That is exactly what I am saying. Only the vice president can succeed to the presidency. The others would execute the powers of the president. What would most likely happen is that the acting president would appoint a vice president, who would succeed immediately when approved by congress.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.134.34" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.134.34">162.158.134.34</a> 07:50, 12 June 2018 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Point 1: There would be no acting president. Only the vice president can become acting president when the president is incapacitated. This and the office of president being vacant are covered in entirely separate parts of the constitution. The line of succession applies only in the latter case.</dd>
<dd>Point 2: That was established in congressional legislation. Only the Vice President can become President when the President is incapcaitated, the rest act using the powers of the president but are not themselves the president.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
