<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures">CVE</a> (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized format for assigning an identity to a cybersecurity vulnerability (similar to the way that astronomical bodies are assigned unique identifiers by committees). Giving vulnerabilities a unique identifier makes them easier to talk about and helps in keeping track of the progress made toward resolving them. The typical format of a CVE identifier is <b>CVE-[YEAR]-[NUMBER]</b>. For example, the CVE identifier for 2017's widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Meltdown (security vulnerability)">Meltdown vulnerability</a> is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754">CVE-2017-5754</a>. CVEs also contain a short description of the issue.
</p><p>In this comic (released in February 2018), Randall presents a number of spurious predicted CVEs for later in 2018. Each CVE identifier is given as "CVE-2018-?????", reflecting the fact that they have not yet happened so we don't know exactly what their CVE identifier will be.
</p><p>Following are short descriptions of all the <i>vulnerabilities</i> mentioned in the comic.
</p>
<dl><dt>Apple products crash when displaying certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Telugu language">Telugu</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bengali language">Bengali</a> letter combinations.</dt>
<dd>This refers to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/iphone-text-bomb-ios-mac-crash-apple/">real vulnerability</a> in iOS and MacOS publicized a few days before the comic was released, as well as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/01/18/iphone-ipad-apple-text-ios-bug/">past</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/01/18/apple-text-bomb-can-crash-iphones-single-message/">similar</a> iOS vulnerabilities.</dd>
<dt>An attacker can use a timing attack to extploit [<i>sic</i>] a race condition in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Garbage collection (computer science)">garbage collection</a> to extract a limited number of bits from the Wikipedia article on Claude Shannon.</dt>
<dd>The reference to using a Timing Attack to exploit a race condition in garbage collection refers to Meltdown and Spectre CPU flaws that can be exploited in a cloud server like the ones in Wikipedia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> was an early and highly influential information scientist whose work underlies compression, encryption, security, and the theory behind how information is encoded into binary digits. </dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>This is not a security problem, since Wikipedia articles are public. However, since Shannon formulated how the amount of unique or actual information some entity contains is proportional to the number of bits required to encode it, retrieving only a few bits casts a dark perspective upon the significance of the Shannon article's content.</dd>
<dt>At the cafe on Third Street, the Post-it note with the WiFi password is visible from the sidewalk.</dt>
<dd>Cafés often offer free access to WiFi as a service to patrons, as a business strategy to encourage said patrons to remain in the building and buy more coffee. Some use a password, so that only patrons can use the WiFi, and may display the password on signage inside. Since anybody could go into the cafe to read the post-it, and then use the network from nearby, the ability to read it from outside is, at most, a trivial problem. For systems that are supposed to be secure, writing passwords in a visible place is a major security flaw. For instance, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hawaii_false_missile_alert" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2018 Hawaii false missile alert">2018 Hawaii false missile alert</a>, the agency concerned received criticism for a press photo showing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/hawaii-emergency-agency-password-discovered-in-photo-sparks-security-criticism-2018-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">a password written on a sticky note</a> attached to a monitor.</dd>
<dt>A remote attacker can inject arbitrary text into public-facing pages via the comments box.</dt>
<dd>Describes a common feature on news sites or social media sites like Facebook. The possibility for users to "inject" text into the page is by design. This is a humorous reference to the relatively common security vulnerability "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cross-site scripting">persistent cross-site scripting</a>", where input provided by a user, such as through a comment section, can result in dangerous content containing arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code being displayed to other users. </dd>
<dt>MySQL server 5.5.45 secretly runs two parallel databases for people who say "S-Q-L" and "sequel."</dt>
<dd>Some people pronounce "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:SQL">SQL</a>" like "sequel", after SQL's predecessor "SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language)". The standard for SQL suggests that it should be pronounced as separate letters; however, the author of SQL pronounces it "sequel", so the debate persists (with even more justification than arguments about how to pronounce "GIF"). MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. The latest generally available version (at the time of writing) is MySQL 5.7.</dd>
<dt>A flaw in some x86 CPUs could allow a root user to de-escalate to normal account privileges.</dt>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Privilege escalation">Privilege escalation</a> refers to any illegitimate means by which a system user gains greater access privileges than they are supposed to have. The most highly-sought privilege is that of the root user, which allows complete access to an entire system&#8212; a <i>superuser</i>. Any flaw that would allow an ordinary user to escalate to superuser status is a critical security threat, as they then have full control of the machine. This is what most hackers seek to achieve when attacking a device.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>This CVE presents the less-threatening reverse situation: allowing a root user to <i>de-escalate</i> to normal account privileges. In fact, root users can already do this at any time; superuser privileges allow them to take control of any user account, so they can simply switch to an account which has fewer privileges than the root user.</dd>
<dt>Apple products catch fire when displaying emoji with diacritics.</dt>
<dd>This is a reference to a common problem of modern gadgets catching fire (usually related to flaws in lithium-ion batteries), as well as to Apple products crashing when attempting to display certain character sequences. Diacritics are the accents found on letters in some languages (eg. č, ģ ķ, ļ, ņ, š, ž). These would not normally be found on emojis. 🔥̃ is an example of such an emoji.</dd>
<dt>An oversight in the rules allows a dog to join a basketball team.</dt>
<dd>This probably refers to the movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Bud" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Air Bud">Air Bud</a></i>, about a dog playing basketball. This has been a common theme in xkcd comics: see <a href="/wiki/index.php/115:_Meerkat" title="115: Meerkat">115: Meerkat</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1439:_Rack_Unit" title="1439: Rack Unit">1439: Rack Unit</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1819:_Sweet_16" title="1819: Sweet 16">1819: Sweet 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1552:_Rulebook" title="1552: Rulebook">1552: Rulebook</a>.</dd>
<dd>In 2017, it was discovered that an oversight in the constitution of the state of Kansas may <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article175956836.html">permit a dog to be governor</a>. Shortly before this comic published, the Secretary of State's office ruled that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/02/13/dog-kansas-governor/">it could not</a>.</dd>
<dt>Haskell isn't side-effect-free after all; the effects are all just concentrated in this one computer in Missouri that no one's checked on in a while.</dt>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Haskell (programming language)">Haskell</a> is a functional programming language. Functional programming is characterized by using functions that don't have side effects because they can not change things accessible in other parts of the program, as in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1312:_Haskell" title="1312: Haskell">1312: Haskell</a>. The joke here is discovering that it does indeed have side-effects, manifested via external alteration, not violating the internal alteration paradigm. It may also be a reference to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_From_Omelas" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas">The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</a>," a short story by Ursula Le Guin in which a utopian city concentrates all its misery into one child who is locked away in a basement.</dd>
<dt>Nobody really knows how hypervisors work.</dt>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hypervisor">"Hypervisors"</a> are a tool for computer virtualization. Virtualization is implemented via various combinations of hardware and/or software, which requires a computer to completely simulate another computer, with its own unique hardware and software, and to varying degrees as to whether or not the virtualization is aware of or can determine whether it is being virtualized. Many IT professionals and businesses rely heavily on various forms of virtualization, but most of the individual employees would be hard-pressed to explain how it works. Programs running on other virtual computers, or on the real computer, may be able to access information on a virtual computer in ways which would not be possible with a single real computer. Consequently, understanding how the hypervisor works is important to assessing the security of a virtual server. Meltdown and Spectre are related to this.</dd>
<dt>Critical&#x3a; Under Linux 3.14.8 on System/390 in a UTC+14 time zone, a local user could potentially use a buffer overflow to change another user's default system clock from 12-hour to 24-hour.</dt>
<dd>This joke is about arcane systems that are running Linux in exceedingly rare situations, meaning that reproducing errors would be incredibly difficult or inconvenient, and would only affect a very tiny user base (if any at all). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390_ES/9000_Enterprise_Systems_Architecture_ESA_family" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IBM System/390 ES/9000 Enterprise Systems Architecture ESA family">System/390</a> is an IBM mainframe introduced almost 30 years before this comic, which has a version of Linux. UTC+14 is a time zone used only on some islands in the Pacific Ocean (Primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Islands" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Line Islands">the Line Islands</a>) and is also the earliest time zone on Earth. Even if all of these absurd conditions were met, the resulting vulnerability would still be relatively benign: simply changing a user's preferred clock display format. Other xkcd comics make references to such obscure computer-time issues relating to time zones and time conversions, and how many programmers find these issues frustrating or even traumatizing. </dd>
<dt>x86 has way too many instructions.</dt>
<dd>The x86 architecture (used in many Intel and AMD processors) is very complicated. Processors typically implement such a complex architecture using programs (microcode) run on a set of hidden, proprietary processors. The details of these hidden machines and errors in the microcode can result in security vulnerabilities, such as Meltdown, where the physical machine does not match the conceptual machine.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>A more complicated instruction set is more complex to implement.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> The x86 architecture is considered "CISC" (a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Complex instruction set computer">Complex instruction set computer</a>"), having many instructions originally provided to make programming by a human simpler; other examples include the 68000 series used in the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>. In the 1980s, this design philosophy was countered by the "RISC" ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Reduced instruction set computer">Reduced instruction set computer</a>") design movement - based on the observation that computer programs were increasingly generated by compilers (which only used a few instructions) rather than directly by people, and that the chip area dedicated to extra instructions could be better dedicated to, for example, cache. Examples of RISC style designs include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:SPARC">SPARC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:MIPS">MIPS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:PowerPC">PowerPC</a> (used by Apple in later Macintoshes) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ARM architecture">ARM</a> chips common in mobile phones. Historically, there was considerable discussion about the merits of each approach. At one time the Mac and Windows PC were on different sides; owners of other competing systems such as the Archimedes and Amiga had similar arguments on usenet in the early 1990s. This "issue" may be posted by someone who still recalls these debates. Technically, the extra instructions do slightly complicate the task of validating correct chip behaviour and complicate the tool chains that manage software, which could be seen as a minor security risk. However, the 64-bit architecture introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:AMD">AMD</a>, and since adopted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Intel">Intel</a>, does rationalize things somewhat, and all recent x86 chips break down instructions into RISC-like micro-operations, so the complication from a hardware perspective is localized. Recent security issues, such as the speculative cache load issue in Meltdown and Spectre, depend more on details of implementation, rather than instruction set, and have been exhibited both by x86 (CISC) and ARM (RISC) processors.</dd>
<dt>NumPy 1.8.0 can factor primes in <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) time and must be quietly deprecated before anyone notices.</dt>
<dd>Fantastically, this would be an unimaginable software threat, not to be confused with the even speedier, but future-bound, threat in hardware via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Quantum computing">Quantum computing</a>. </dd>
<dd>NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with the programming language Python. <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Infinite_asymptotics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Big O notation">Big O notation</a> meaning that the time it takes for a computer algorithm to run is in the order of log <i>n</i>, for an input of size <i>n</i>. <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) is very fast and is more usual for a search algorithm. Prime factorization currently is <i>O</i>(<i>2</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>n)). If something can find the prime factors of a number this quickly, especially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semiprime" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:semiprime">semiprime</a> with two large factors, it will enable attacks to break many crypto functions used in internet security. However, prime numbers have only a single factor, and "factoring primes" quickly is a simpler problem, that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Primality test">proving that a number is in fact a prime</a>. </dd>
<dt>Apple products grant remote access if you send them words that break the "I before E" rule.</dt>
<dd>Another joke on the first CVE and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_before_E_except_after_C" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:I before E except after C">a common English writing rule of thumb</a>, which fails almost as often as it succeeds.

<dt>Skylake x86 chips can be pried from their sockets using certain flathead screwdrivers.</dt>
<dd>Skylake x86 chips are a line of microprocessors made by Intel. Some processors are soldered directly to a system board or daughter board, while others are attached to boards that plug into the system board by means of a socket (pins or connectors that make physical contact with receptacles or connectors on a system board). Some sockets, especially older ones, require force to insert or remove, and often require the use of a flat blade screwdriver or a specialized tool, but most modern ones use ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) techniques, often involving a lever or similar to tighten or loosen the friction/tightness of the contacts. No screwdriver is needed in this case. However, any processor <i>can</i> be forcefully removed from its socket with a screwdriver.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup></dd>
<dt>Apparently Linus Torvalds can be bribed pretty easily.</dt>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Benevolent dictator for life">benevolent dictator for life</a> of the Linux kernel codebase. Normally it is hard to make changes because he has the last word, and because the kernel is replicated in all Linux installations. Linus made the news in January 2018 when, having looked at one of Intel's proposed fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, he declared "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/linus-torvalds-declares-intel-fix-for-meltdown-spectre-complete-and-utter-garbage/">the patches are COMPLETE AND UTTER GARBAGE</a>". Presumably, it may be found that he may be successfully bribed to be less blunt and/or less critical of vulnerability fixes that are complete and/or utter garbage. If this were the case, this would be a severe critical vulnerability to all Linux servers and machines.</dd>
<dt>An attacker can execute malicious code on their own machine and no one can stop them.</dt>
<dd>The point of an attack is to make someone else's machine perform actions against the owner's will. Anyone can make their own machine execute any code if they have root access and the necessary tools, but this would usually not be described as an attack, except in the case of a locked-down appliance, such as a video game console, a John Deere tractor, or pay TV decoder.</dd>
<dt>Apple products execute any code printed over a photo of a dog with a saddle and a baby riding it.</dt>
<dd>This could refer to a CVE vulnerability of JPG files where JavaScript embedded within the image file is executed by some application. In this case, though, the code is visible on the image instead of invisibly encoded within the image file. The code is also only executed if the image contains a photo of a baby in a saddle riding a dog. It's unclear whether the photo would be a digital photo, a printed photo (i.e. as taken using a digital camera), or maybe both. </dd>
<dd>Other than by some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Metadata">metadata</a>, either internal to the image file, or embedded along with it, as in a web page, or a PDF or other container file, this "bug" would require the device to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_AI" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hard AI">figure out</a> specifically what the photo contains image-wise (something that's REALLY HARD for computers to do reliably), but would also require OCR (optical character recognition) code to convert the text superimposed on the photo into executable code. In other words, it's hard to believe in 2018 that such a bug could exist. Maybe in the future when such things are more routine...? As an example, OCR used to be hard to do reliably, but now it's a lot more routine and built into a lot of devices.</dd>
<dt>Under rare circumstances, a flaw in some versions of Windows could allow Flash to be installed.</dt>
<dd>Adobe Flash has been an integral browser plugin for decades, but has fallen out of favor in the 2010s, and eventually discontinued because of its notoriously abysmal security record. All security experts advise against installing it. Preventing installation of Flash would make systems more secure, but most versions of Windows do not prevent Flash installation (provided, as of 2021, the user still has a copy of the files with which to do so). The joke here relates to the difficulty of keeping Flash up to date, or even installed properly to begin with. A common user experience, which is the subject of numerous jokes and memes, is the constant nagging notification to install or update Flash in order for web pages to display properly. Many IT professionals will bemoan the trouble they have experienced in the workplace due to these notifications and problems related to them.</dd>
<dd>In late 2020, Microsoft <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4577586/update-for-removal-of-adobe-flash-player">released an optional Windows update</a> that removes Flash and prevents that users can install it again.</dd>
<dt>Turns out the cloud is just other people's computers.</dt>
<dd>This refers to a meme that demands that "cloud" be replaced with "other people's computers" in all marketing presentation to CEOs and non-computer literate persons evaluating the security impact of using cloud services. Part of the humor here is that "the cloud" is, in actuality, simply a term for hosted services, or in other words computers being run by other people (typically businesses that specialize in this type of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_Service" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Platform as a Service">Platform as a Service</a>" or "PaaS" service model). Referring to "the cloud" as "other people's computers" is, at its core, entirely accurate, though it takes away the business jargon and simplifies the situation in such a way that it might cast doubt on the security, reliability, and general effectiveness of using "cloud" solutions.  In <a href="/wiki/index.php/908:_The_Cloud" title="908: The Cloud">908: The Cloud</a>, it turns out that <a href="/wiki/index.php/Black_Hat" title="Black Hat">Black Hat</a> is the "other people" whose computer <i>is</i> the Cloud.</dd>
<dt>A flaw in Mitre's CVE database allows arbitrary code insertion.<a href="/wiki/index.php/779" class="mw-redirect" title="779">[~~CLICK HERE FOR CHEAP VIAGRA~~]</a></dt>
<dd>Mitre's CVE database is where all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures">CVEs</a> are stored. This log message forms the punchline of the comic, as it implies that all of the exaggerated error messages above might have been inserted by hackers exploiting the vulnerability.

<dl><dd> Thank you so much for using a list instead of a table! I read this on an Android phone, and tables on this site are hard to read.  The first column comes out with really small text, and since the cell vertical alignment is not 'top' I have to scroll down to find what the row is about, then scroll back up to try to find the rest of the row. Your list format is far superior IMO <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.38.58" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.38.58">162.158.38.58</a> 11:49, 24 February 2020 (UTC)

<p>Never ever have I heard anyone pronounce SQL as "sequel" - Is that a reqional dialect? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.93.15" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.93.15">162.158.93.15</a> 07:41, 19 February 2018 (UTC)

<dd> Not sure if it's regional or not.  I personally say "sequel" and I'd say anecdotally that it's about 50/50 among people that I've worked with.

<dd> When I was in college a couple decades back I have memory of the professor that taught SQL saying that pronouncing it "sequel" had been registered as a trademark of Micosoft.

<dl><dd> AFAIK, there aren't any primality tests known to run in O(log n). For instance, AKS runs in O(log n ^ 7.5).

<dl><dd>Doesn't testing for primality (just) require a list of all primes up to sqrt(n)? So the best possible time is sqrt(however fast you can calculate primes up to a number). That time can at most be square (divide every number by every other number below it), so a primality test only needs O(n) time.

<dd>On the other hand, consider the following phrases that describe a process using the end result of the process as their direct object: "cook scrambled eggs", "bake a cake", "chop firewood", "encode an MP3", and "factor primes". One would "factor primes" out of the semiprime associated with an RSA key. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tepples&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tepples (page does not exist)">Tepples</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tepples&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tepples (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:58, 19 February 2018 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> There are a bunch of things going on:</dd>
<dd>  * NumPy currently has no primality or factoring functions.  SymPy does.  We assume the hypothetical CVE happened because someone added it.</dd>
<dd>  * Factoring a prime is a bit nonsensical.  We factor into primes or perform a primality test.  Perhaps a reference to the humorously mis-spoken Bill Gates quote: "The obvious mathematical breakthrough would be development of an easy way to factor large prime numbers." -Bill Gates, The Road Ahead, pg. 265.  We know what he meant (and he likely does too) but it's technically just wrong.</dd>
<dd>  * The best known factoring methods are sub-exponential, not polynomial as $O(\log n)$ indicates.  The current explanation test here is factually wrong (but gets the concept across) -- it isn't $O(2^n)$.</dd>
<dd>  * Deterministic 64-bit primality testing is $O(\log^2 n)$ using BPSW or deterministic Miller-Rabin.  This worse than $O(\log n)$.</dd>
<dd>  * Heuristic or probabilistic testing for larger inputs is also $O(\log^2 n)$.  The best deterministic method for larger inputs is ECPP at $O(\log^4 n)$, which is faster than AKS's $O(\log^6 n)$ in addition to much smaller constants.</dd>
<dd> Ignoring or being amused at the "factoring primes" comment, we see the complexity is actually in the correct form (most internet forum contributers mix up "n" vs. "size of n", for example).  If it were factoring composites, then $O(log^k n)$ for any constant 'k' would be funny as it says nobody noticed they added a polynomial time factoring algorithm.  If it is primality testing then it's funny as-is since this is faster than any known method (basically saying you could do a primality test on any size input with a constant number of multiplies).</dd>

<dl><dd>Isn't the joke really in the hilarious severity assessment? The vulnerability is supposedly CRITICAL!!!!11!1!!one!, while description shows both a ridiculously small vulnerable population and ridiculously low impact. Population: a single, very old kernel version on a rare, outdated architecture, in one timezone only - and WHICH timezone! UTC+14 means just a couple of islands in the Pacific (Tonga, Kiribati...) - the probability of even one vulnerable system actually existing seems almost zero. Impact: the only possible consequence is switching from 12h to 24h (only in this direction)?

<p>It's my first comment here, so I may be wrong. I see the "CRITICAL" as a "differential” joke exhibiting that the requirement standards may be very different from a constructor to another. In fact, it seems that the apple’s bugs described here (crash, fire, remote access granted) are the mosst critical ones. The only two concerning Linux are the one labeled as critical and the one about bribery. I don’t know what to think about the almost complete absence of windows though. Feriaman.

<pre>Apple products execute any code printed over a photo of a dog with a saddle and a baby riding it.
... This "bug" would not only require the device to figure out specifically what the photo contains image-wise, something that's REALLY HARD for computers to do reliably, it would also require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) type code to convert the text superimposed on the photo into executable code. In other words, it's hard to believe in 2018 that such a bug could exist. Maybe in the future when such things are more routine...? ...
</pre>
<p>The funny thing is that I don't think it's beyond the realm of plausibility.  Given the fact that modern operating systems try to index as much as possible, for faster searches, it seems logical that some OS (if not now, then in the future) would try to run OCR against every image and video in order to index whatever text it finds (much like how YouTube auto-generates captions by running speech-recognition over the entire soundtrack).  Ditto for more generic image recognition to identify and index the picture content.  A system that does this could easily end up with a bug (or back door) where certain kinds of image content result in an attempt to execute its OCR results as code.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Shamino" title="User:Shamino">Shamino</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Shamino&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Shamino (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:03, 20 February 2018 (UTC)

</p><p>While it is true that part of the plot of the movie "Air Bud" was that there was nothing in the rules to prevent a dog joining a basketball team, I suspect that the recent attempt to run a dog as candidate for governor of Kansas was more on Randal's mind than a 20+ year old movie that (at most) a few million people saw when it was released.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.78.16" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.78.16">162.158.78.16</a> 05:27, 22 February 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Actually, I find AirBud has become more of a thing to reference than a movie to watch. I believe the idea has been recycled a few times (a dog playing football, I think a dog playing baseball), yet it's AirBud, the original, that's always getting referenced (okay, "always" is an overstatement, but still). At the very least I know Randall has referenced it a few times, sometimes by name, enough times that I'd say it's safe to say AirBud is on his list of favourite references. If anything, this dog governor sounds obscure enough that he may not have heard about it, making the AirBud reference more likely, though being wacky politics I wouldn't be surprised if he's well aware, either.&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">NiceGuy1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:NiceGuy1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NiceGuy1 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:49, 23 February 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>
