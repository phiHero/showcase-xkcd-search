<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Toast (honor)">toast</a> is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be "the toast of the evening," for whom someone "proposes a toast" to congratulate and for whom a third person "toasts" in agreement.
</p><p>The comic is based on the quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_for_My_Real_Friends,_Real_Pain_for_My_Sham_Friends" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends">Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends</a> which, though often attributed to the painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(artist)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Francis Bacon (artist)">Francis Bacon</a> or to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tom Waits">Tom Waits</a>, is a toast dating back to at least the nineteenth century. It is also the entire title of a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7q9i6KYmzQ">song</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Under_the_Cork_Tree#Track_listing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:From Under the Cork Tree">ninth track</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Under_the_Cork_Tree" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:From Under the Cork Tree">From  Under the Cork Tree</a>, a 2005 album by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Out_Boy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fall Out Boy">Fall Out Boy</a>.
</p><p>The comic plays on a permutation structure between two words (a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Chiasmus">chiasmus</a>), yielding puns with various effects.  In this comic eight persons drink a <b>toast</b> for their "real friends" and then for some other type of "friends". For the real friend they wish them to have one specific thing. This something is a word (X-Y) that can be split up in two meanings (X and Y), where one of them are then put in front the word friend, to explain what type of friends they are now toasting (often a bad/false type of friend) and then these friends get a wish for having what the word that are left of the original word means: "X-Y for my real friends and real Y for my X friends"
</p><p>The first example is a typical toast, in Champagne, where this word can be split in the two phonetically similar words Sham and Pain, and the sham friends then get pain. <a href="#The_toasts">Below</a> all examples (including the ninth from the title text) are listed with explanation for all words. In some cases the word may actually refer to a drink (like the first with champagne), so that the first word is not something wished for the real friends, but the drink that is in the glass (these have been mentioned below). But for other toasts there is no such drink in existence, and the first word is the thing the toaster wishes for the real friends.

<ul><li><i>Champagne</i> sounds like a combination of the two words <i>sham</i> and <i>pain</i>.
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Champagne">Champagne</a> is an expensive sparkling wine.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sham">Sham</a> means false.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pain">Pain</a> is not so nice to hand out.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
<ul><li>So <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> toast his real friends with Champagne and wishes real pain to his false friends.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><i>Pseudopods</i> can be divided into <i>pseudo-</i> and <i>pods</i>.
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopods" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pseudopods">Pseudopods</a> (which translate to "false feet") are temporary cytoplasm-filled parts of the cell wall that are able to change their form in order to move. They are used in some eukaryotic cells to move around or to eat. Most cells that do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Amoeba">amoeboids</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(genus)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Amoeba (genus)">amoeba</a> is a common example. There is no drink named Pseudopods!</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pseudo-">Pseudo-</a> (lying, false) is used to mark something that superficially appears to be (or behaves like) one thing, but actually is another.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pods" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pods">Pods</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pod">pod</a> is not clearly defined. It could refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_plant_morphology#Fruit_types" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Glossary of plant morphology">seedpod</a> – a dry dehiscent fruit containing many seeds.  Pods, both malevolent and benignant, appear in many works of SF and Fantasy.
<ul><li>So <a href="/wiki/index.php/Blondie" title="Blondie">Blondie</a> will give her real friends a special part/adaptation of the amoeba. (Doesn't everyone wish they had pseudopods?) But it at least seems better than her pseudo-friends who would receive real pods with intricate ways to kill them.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><i>Petticoats</i> sounds like a combination of the two words <i>petty</i> and <i>coats</i>
<ul><li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Petticoat">petticoat</a> or underskirt is an article of clothing; specifically an undergarment to be worn under a skirt or a dress. There is no drink named petticoats!</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/petty">Petty</a> means small (in rank of importance), insignificant or narrow-minded. See for instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_crime" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Petty crime">petty crime</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_(clothing)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Coat (clothing)">coat</a> is a garment worn by both men and women, for warmth or fashion.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>
<ul><li>So <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> will hand out undergarments for her real friends (a very personal gift) and coats for her less important/insignificant or narrow-minded friends (they seem to be the luckier ones here).</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><i>Loosestrife</i> can be divided into <i>loose</i> and <i>strife</i>.
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loosestrife" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Loosestrife">Loosestrife</a> is a common name for plants within two different genera (which are not related): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lythrum" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lythrum">Lythrum</a> (example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lythrum_salicaria" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lythrum salicaria">purple loosestrife</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysimachia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lysimachia">Lysimachia</a> (example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysimachia_ciliata" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lysimachia ciliata">Fringed Loosestrife</a>). There is a patent for a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com.na/patents/CN1154814A?cl=en">loosestrife drink</a> but it seems unlikely that this is in the glass.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loose">Loose</a> in this case means free from restraints, as the opposite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_friend" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Close friend">close friend</a>. Loose can also refer to being sexually promiscuous, especially when used as an adjective for people.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/strife">Strife</a> refers to bitter, sometimes violent, conflict or discord.
<ul><li>So the "brunette" woman (i.e. similar hair but less dark than Megan) will give her real friends flowers and for her promiscuous friend she wishes they end up in a real violent conflict.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><i>Ladybugs</i> can be divided into <i>lady</i> and <i>bugs</i>.
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladybugs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ladybugs">Ladybugs</a> (or Ladybird) are a family of insects common all over the world. They are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://photobucket.com/images/cute%20ladybug">considered cute</a>. There also exists a recipe for a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.1001cocktails.com/recipes/mixed-drinks/104741/cocktail-ladybug.html"><i>ladybug</i> cocktail</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lady">Lady</a> is a civil term of respect for a woman, specifically the female equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gentleman">gentleman</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lord">lord</a>, but in many contexts a term for any adult woman.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bugs">Bugs</a> in this case refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Insects">insects</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnids" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Arachnids">arachnids</a>. It could also refer to the scientific classification <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>, the "true bugs", which does not include ladybugs.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairbun" title="Hairbun">Hairbun</a> toasts her real friends in the <i>ladybug</i> cocktail - it could be a cocktail glass she is holding - (rather than giving the ladybugs for her real friends, even though they are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zazzle.com/cute+ladybug">cute bugs</a> that most people are not afraid of). And then she will bestow real bugs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetles" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Beetles">beetles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flies" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Flies">flies</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiders" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spiders">spiders</a>) to her lady friends. This is not necessarily all her female friends, it could be only those that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady#British_nobility" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lady">noble</a> or at least think they are more important and thus would like to be called lady.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><i>Single-payer</i> can be divided into <i>single,</i> and payer, a word that rhymes with <i>player</i>. In this case this word is then put together with real to form the word <i>RealPlayer</i>.
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Single-payer">Single-payer</a> refers to single-payer healthcare, a system in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Healthcare">healthcare</a> costs, a system used in several countries, but not so far in the US; it was initially considered but ultimately rejected when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a>, also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obamacare" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Obamacare">Obamacare</a> by both detractors and supporters of the law, was discussed, passed by the US House and Senate, and signed into law by President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>. There is no drink named single-payer!</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_person" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Single person">Single</a> refers to a person who is not in a relationship or is unmarried.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:RealPlayer">RealPlayer</a> is a cross-platform media player app, developed by RealNetworks. It is compatible with numerous container file formats of the multimedia realm. In the past it has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Reviews_and_critiques" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:RealPlayer">criticized</a> for containing adware and spyware. This was back from 1999 and up to the 2004 version.</li>
<li>It is specifically <b>not</b> the word <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Single-player video game">single-player</a></i> that is used! This word could refer to video games that only one player can play at a time, or when choosing to play single-player in a game where more could have played. <i>RealPayer</i> is <b>not</b> a word in use.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/index.php/White_Hat" title="White Hat">White Hat</a> thus wishes that his real friends have access to state-funded health care, and all his single friends will get RealPlayer. Since <a href="/wiki/index.php/White_Hat" title="White Hat">White Hat</a> is normally benevolent, if naïve, he may imagine that RealPlayer will help his single friends enjoy Internet media, when they are home alone.  Maybe he wishes to impress these singles with a free app as a present in the hope that he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Lucky_(Daft_Punk_song)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)">gets lucky</a>. If it has been <a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairy" title="Hairy">Hairy</a> this would have seemed very likely… see <a href="/wiki/index.php/1178:_Pickup_Artists" title="1178: Pickup Artists">1178: Pickup Artists</a>. White Hat has not previously displayed these tendencies too clearly. As mentioned there have been some issues with RealPlayer in the past, but it has stayed on the market for more than a decade. However, since it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Current_Status" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:RealPlayer">recently been changed</a> into <i>RealTimes</i> it may not be so cool a gift anyway. Also White Hat might wish to give away the old spy ware version of RealPlayer. But as opposed to most of the special type of friends, <i>single-friends</i> is not in itself a negative type of friend, especially not if you are yourself single.

<li><i>Platonic solids</i> can be divided into <i>platonic</i> and <i>solids</i>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Platonic solids">Platonic solids</a>: In three-dimensional space, a platonic solid is a regular, convex polyhedron. It is constructed by congruent regular polygonal faces with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Five solids meet those criteria, and each is named after its number of faces: Tetrahedron (a.k.a. "Regular triangle-based pyramid"), Hexahedron ("Cube"), Octahedron (can be considered the union of two square-based pyramids, base-to-base), Dodecahedron and Icosahedron. There is no drink named platonic solids!</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/platonic">Platonic</a> means <i>not sexual in nature</i> as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Platonic love">platonic love</a>, which is a type of love that is celibate and non-sexual. Platonic friends are friends who will never have sex with each other.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Solid">Solid</a> is one of the three fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid and gas). <i>Doing someone a solid</i> can also mean <i>doing someone a favor</i>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>, must be speaking the title text and he wishes his real friends to have material in regular, convex polyhedron shape where as his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_friends" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Platonic friends">platonic friends</a> can get any other kind of solid material, alternatively a solid favor. Platonic friends are not necessarily bad to have so maybe it should be a positive toast for those as well. On the other hand, sometimes it is one friend that has decided it should be a platonic friendship. In this case the other may regret this and not wish good things for this friend.</li>
<li>'<i>Solids</i> can also refer to solid human excrement.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>Platonic</i> can also refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_ideal" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Platonic ideal">Platonic ideals</a>, which are models that real-life objects and processes implement only imperfectly.
<ul><li>So while Randall wants his Platonic friends to have solid objects in the imperfect shapes that can exist in real life, he wants his "real friends" to have impossibly perfect hard copies of the regular tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Are we sure "single-payer" is not a typo, making it "single-player" to fit with "RealPlayer"? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.202.144" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.202.144">162.158.202.144</a> 11:18, 19 February 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Randall often corrects comic with errors, and if it had been an error he would probably also have spotted it by now, and it has not changed on xkcd. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:14, 22 February 2016 (UTC)--</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> It seems correct. It is rather abstract, but I guess single-payer here is considered a good thing and RealPlayer a bad thing. Added to rime that a a different type of "player" might be what his single friends need.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.90.165" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.90.165">162.158.90.165</a> 22:38, 19 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'm fairly certain this comic is in reference to the "Fall Out Boy" song, entitled "Champagne For My Real Friends And Real Pain For My Sham Friends", from their 2005 album "From Under The Cork Tree"; though he could also be referencing Francis Bacon, Tom Waits, the television show Happy Days, the show One Tree Hill, or Spike Lee's "25th Hour". If you do a Google search for the phrase, it requires some exclusions (like -"fall out boy") to prevent that song from dominating the first page of results. It's one of their most famous titles.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.48" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.48">108.162.216.48</a> 12:00, 19 February 2016 (UTC)

<pre>Quote from early explantion: White Hat thus wish that his real friends have access to free health care, and all his single friends will get RealPlayer. Maybe he wishes to impress these singles with a present and hope he gets lucky. (If it has been Hairy this would have seemed very likely… see 1178: Pickup Artists. White Hat has not previously displayed thse tendencies to clearly).

<p>I doubt this. RealPlayer was a terrible piece of software nobody wanted and was often bundled with spyware (see wikipedia)  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.70.121" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.70.121">141.101.70.121</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.70.121&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.70.121 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

<dl><dd>Well I wrote it and disagree. Since it has been on the market for 10 years, and has just been updated, then it cannot be that terrible, and I cannot find what you say should be on Wikipedia to show that it should be bad still at present. But of course if it has just been upgraded to a new name, then giving the old app is not so hot. Has addressed this in the explanation.

<dl><dd> You wrote the source code for RealPlayer or the explantation here? If first you should know why it has such a bad reputation, if second: RealPlayer was some time ago bundled with spyware that sent unique ID's with other userdata to a server, also it had several other problems and is considered by several tech magazines as one of the worst software programs. It might not mention that in the english wikipedia but the german has a section for it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Kritik">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Kritik</a> To stay on topic: Maybe he wishes his single friends RealPlayer so they need his help to get the malware off their computers and he can impress them?

Why would anyone else continue to make it better or using it? But again feel free to update the explanation even more with these kinds of info. I still think it is not so bad to get a free app, unless it is the spy ware version.

<dl><dd>There's more to realplayer than adware. Realaudio/realvideo were among the first streaming media formats on the internet. As such, it was used at that time by many adult-oriented sites offering streaming video. It is very possible that the single friends of White Hat might be interested by such media. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.49.25" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.49.25">173.245.49.25</a> 13:04, 21 February 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>As a non-native speaker, when I first read it, I though "petty friends" could mean "pet animals" and "real coats" would then refer to them having real fur as coats - which is often an aspect animal friends don't like on certain rich people (wearing real fur coats), but completely normal for the animals itself.
Also "Realplayer", aside from its repuration as not-so-useable software, is used for video streaming, including on porn sites. So (male?) "single friends", being single, might have to resort using Realplayer/porn to satisfy their needs.

</p><p>In regard to the second tile, I read it at first to mean that the girl's real friends are pseudopods and that all her human acquaintances are "pseudo-friends". This would be like a stereotypical "lab nerd". Doesn't track with any other slide, but I thought it might add to the conversation...  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.221.15" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.221.15">108.162.221.15</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:108.162.221.15&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:108.162.221.15 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

</p><p>The last panel with Beret Guy might be a reference to any French expression using "faucon" ("hawk", sounds like "false cunt") and "vrai con" ("real cunt"). Sorry about the language by the way, but that's exactly what "con" mean, both literally and figuratively. A French equivalent to "Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends" would likely use those—although I can't think about a perfect one. It's usually along the lines "Quelle différence entre toi et un oiseau? Le faucon est un oiseau, toi t'es un vrai con." meaning "What's the difference between a bird and you? The hawk is a bird, you're a real cunt." Also, the current explanation seems really far-fetched to me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.159" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.159">141.101.104.159</a> 20:26, 19 February 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Made the edit. Feel free to argue. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.104.159" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.104.159">141.101.104.159</a> 03:47, 20 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Firstly, I must disagree about "Fauxhawk", that "This <b>IS</b>" a reference to "faucon"/the french version of this phrase. I might go along with "might be". "Fauxhawk" is a word that really is used in the English language, for the described hairstyle. This connection seems only to be a mild coincidence, something better suited to a Trivia section (it DOES make for an interesting tidbit, but too obscure to be on purpose). Seems like a happy accident.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Secondly, I remain unconvinced about "Single-Payer" not being a typo. Seems like a weird term, uncommon. Maybe this is just because I'm Canadian, maybe this term is very wide-spread to Americans, but due to American TV and content we DO hear a lot of American terms. If the intent was indeed to be "single-player", this could be a reference to how more and more video games these days focus on multiplayer/online play, many of which neglect the single-player content, to the point where it seems like the game makers are assuming nobody is interested. As such, this would mean wishing quality single-player gameplay for their real friends.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thirdly, about "pods". I understood it to mean "human container", like a stasis pod or escape pod (a common term for the spaceship equivalent of a lifeboat) Examples of such pods would include where Ripley "stored" herself at the end of Aliens, into the beginning of the next movie, or how baby Superman was transported to Earth. So, this person would be wishing these friends go into stasis, that their fake friends simply go away.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>And YAY! As of this comic I'm caught up, I've now read every xkcd starting from #1!&#160;:) - NiceGuy1<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/198.41.235.215" title="Special:Contributions/198.41.235.215">198.41.235.215</a> 07:36, 20 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The cunt reference is far-fetched. Have removed it. It off course remains here. Also: Yes it is not a typo as Single-payer refers to Single-payer healthcare as now explained above. (And also noted at the top of this discussion page)--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:51, 21 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Is it just me, or does the fact that several of the words also are the names of cocktails (Ladybug, Tumbleweed) have any significance? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.203.146" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.203.146">162.158.203.146</a> 09:23, 20 February 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> My initial reaction to this thought was "no", seeing as those drinks aren't that widespread, for example I feel like I might have heard those cocktail names, but if so rarely and I've no idea as to their contents (i.e. as opposed to drinks like a Screwdriver, a Mimosa or a Black Russian, drinks which are rather universal, such that most adults probably know what's in them). However, on reflection, the original toast names a drink, toasts involve drinking, and both of those items - Ladybugs and Tumbleweeds - make for unpleasant gifts. So now I think this might be a genuine possibility. Does anybody know of any drinks sharing a name with any of the others? ("Single-payer" seems unlikely, but "Pseudopod" for example?) - NiceGuy1<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.218.160" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.218.160">108.162.218.160</a> 10:00, 20 February 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think that for some of the more strange thing to hand out to friends it makes sense that they refeer to the drinks as mentioned - there is even a beer called fauxhawks... I will add this to the explanation for those where there is a drink with that name. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 14:05, 21 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

Are we sure that the title text isn't a reference to Plato's idealised metaphysical forms (which would include the Platonic solids), which stand in contrast to their imperfect instantiations in the real world?  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.70.20" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.70.20">141.101.70.20</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:141.101.70.20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:141.101.70.20 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>

</p><p>Could 'real solids' refer to diet?  When one has been sick, they are often on a liquid diet, and proceed to soft foods like gelatin desserts before moving back to 'real solids'.  Given the number of drinks involved, this seems possible to me. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.43" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.43">173.245.54.43</a> 22:20, 22 February 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>I think it might be worth noting that dice for tabletop games (particularly role playing games such as D&amp;D) tend to be shaped after the platonic solids. Perhaps Randall is suggesting a gaming session with his real friends.  <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Davidgro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Davidgro (page does not exist)">davidgro</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Davidgro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Davidgro (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:21, 6 August 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>It may be important to note that the petticoats for my real friends and real coats for my petty friends may be sexual. She sleeps with her real friends but just gives jackets to petty friends.
