<p>This comic was published the day before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_day_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Election day in the United States">Election day in the United States</a> (November 3, 2020), which features a contentious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2020 United States presidential election">presidential election</a> between the incumbent, President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a>, and the challenger, former Vice President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a>. The United States does not elect presidents by popular vote, but instead uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States Electoral College">electoral college</a> system, with each state getting a predetermined number of electoral votes, and a majority of electoral votes needed to win an election. The previous presidential election in 2016, which involved Trump and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, was won by Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2 percentage points, but won the electoral vote 304-227 (270 was needed to win the election).
</p><p>Electoral college votes are distributed based on the number of congressional representatives of each state, with the most populous state, California, receiving 55 votes, and the least populous states which are Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming receiving 3 votes each, along with the District of Columbia, which as of the writing of this comic was not a state. Because the United States Congress has two legislative houses, with only one (the House of Representatives) apportioning representatives to the states based on their percentage of the US population and the other (the Senate) allocating two senators to every state regardless of population, smaller states have a higher ratio of electoral college votes to population than larger states do. 
</p><p>Additionally, most states (all but Nebraska and Maine) give all of their electoral college votes to whoever earns the most votes in their state. This means that a small change in the percentage of voters who favor one party's candidate over another within a state doesn't make a difference on the final outcome unless that change tips the scales between the two candidates. Therefore, it's easy to predict the final electoral college votes of many states where one party has a clear lead. Other states, including some of the ones listed by Randall, are considered "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Swing state">swing states</a>", as they are competitive to both of the two major parties, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>. 
</p><p>Together, these factors make voting in some states - "swing states" with smaller populations - much more likely to influence the outcome of the election than others. Randall in this comic is encouraging his readers to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Get out the vote">get out the vote</a>" and encourage voting among their friends and family who live in these nineteen states which are most likely to affect the outcome of the election. The rest of the 31 states (and, presumably, the District of Columbia) are grouped under the "all other states" bucket, presumably as their election outcome is "safely" for Biden or Trump.
</p><p>Per many analysts, the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> is considered an absolute necessity for Trump, and considered very important for Biden. This is why Pennsylvania is weighted the most heavily in Randall's comic.
</p><p>Of course, just because a state may be a clear win for one party does not mean the votes of anyone who votes for the other party are wasted. A higher percentage of voters voting for the losing candidate sends a signal that the state is more competitive than assumed, which forces representatives to compromise and could make future voters more likely to show up because they believe their vote is more likely to matter. Additionally, many "down-ballot" races, like races for governorships, US Congress, state legislatures, and county governments, may be more competitive than the presidential race, and may have just as much or more impact on most people's lives. Randall accounts for some of these local races in deciding how to rank the states on the scoresheet.
</p><p>The text at the bottom says to post your scoresheet with <i>#Hashtag</i>. The "#" symbol (pronounced "hash") denotes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hashtag">hashtag</a> on platforms like Twitter, used to tag one's post as relating to the topic named following the symbol. However, this hashtag (said out-loud as "Hashtag Hashtag") would relate a post to the topic of hashtags rather than elections or votes, and so for the scoresheet is nonsensical and doesn't describe anything useful. It also refers to Nate Silver's famous election forecast model at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:FiveThirtyEight">FiveThirtyEight</a>. Randall closes by urging people to contact Nate Silver to tell him to adjust his model to account for the added votes they have caused, but as the form doesn't indicate which candidate the filler has voted for or plans to vote for, never mind the people contacted, there's no way for him to know what sort of update to make.  Perhaps the flurry of posts bearing the hashtag "#Hashtag" and indicating an effort to increase civic engagement will be a heartwarming surprise on a day that will probably be very busy and stressful for him.
</p><p>The title text explains that even if one thinks that their family and friends always vote, or that their reminder to vote won't work, they should do so anyway because of the chance they may be wrong.
</p><p>As shown in previous comics (<a href="/wiki/index.php/1756:_I%27m_With_Her" title="1756: I&#39;m With Her">1756: I'm With Her</a> and others), Randall was a supporter of 2016 candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> (who ran against Trump), but this announcement should be equally applicable to supporters of either of the two main candidates in the current presidential race.

</p><p>I always told myself that if I ever joined Twitter (rather than 'browse-lurked' the feeds  of people of interest, as I do now) I would use #hashtag a lot, and other ironic self-referential things in order to stop myself taking it too seriously.

<dl><dd>Not sure. However, according to [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population">wikipedia</a>] they have the 3rd lowest population per electoral vote ratio (of the proper states), meaning that an alaskan vote in theory counts more than a texan one (which has the highest ratio). But don't ask me. I am a European with no big clue about that complicated US election system. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lupo" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Lupo" title="User talk:Lupo">talk</a>) 06:29, 3 November 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd> That's ok, I'm not convinced most Americans understand it either. But then, I don't understand why so many Americans think that compulsory voting is un-democratic - particularly compared to a situation where those in power get to deliberately interfere with voters' ability to vote at all. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Paddles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Paddles (page does not exist)">Paddles</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Paddles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Paddles (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:23, 3 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>It seems that "538" is a reference to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com">https://fivethirtyeight.com</a> which seems to be a USA election news aggregation website. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.80" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.80">108.162.216.80</a> 07:30, 3 November 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>0h, and on a second look 538 is mentioned.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.216.80" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.216.80">108.162.216.80</a> 07:38, 3 November 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Uhm 538 is the number of electors in the United States electoral college, which FiveThirtyEight is named after, so it is not a reference to that program. But the note about Nate Silver of course is about him and his website. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:22, 3 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I don't know if Randall knew about or intended the reference, but there is a website <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://hashtaghashtag.org/">http://hashtaghashtag.org/</a>, describing itself as "#Hashtag is dedicated to political analysis and long-form opinion pieces on politics and public policy." Or maybe he just wanted to be a smart-ass with the #Hastag. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Bischoff" title="User:Bischoff">Bischoff</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Bischoff" title="User talk:Bischoff">talk</a>) 07:47, 3 November 2020 (UTC)
</p><p>Before "Hashtag" existed, "#' was sometimes just called "hash". Once it was combined with a word (e.g. "#blart") and use to tag things like tweets, the combined unit was called a "hashtag" (i.e. a tag containing a hash symbol). At some point "#blart" changed from being read as "hash blart" (essentially reading the individual symbols that make it up) to "hashtag blart" (the meaning of the combined symbols), sort of how "$10" is read as "ten dollars" rather than "dollar-sign ten". But then taking the reading "hashtag blart" and back-applying it to the text "#blart" has produced the use of the term "hashtag" for the "#" symbol. Hopefully this won't go around the circle again and make "hashtagtags".
</p>
<dl><dd>Really, though, '#' is still just called "hash". The "-tag" part refers to the whole string making up a topic description tag for the comment/tweet/blurb/whatever. "Hashtag" refers to a tag denoted by a hash symbol, and "#hashtag" prompts the system to link the user to other tweets by people discussing adding semantic meaning to user-generated text. Great for those of us who are super into text markup and metadata (though really, who isn't?). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Kjmitch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kjmitch (page does not exist)">Kjmitch</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Kjmitch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Kjmitch (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:01, 4 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Too early to say much about much, but eventually something like "(Pennsylvania narrowly went for) Trump, but did not stop Biden's win" or "(...) Trump, giving vital EVs to support his second term". Conversely, if it ever flips, what it meant for Biden. - I leave the content open to our future selves to fill in, but I suggest short, snappy and factual only, given the prior column's more wordy vague speculation from ahead of time. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.105.250" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.105.250">141.101.105.250</a> 15:40, 5 November 2020 (UTC)
