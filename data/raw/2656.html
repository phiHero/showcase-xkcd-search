<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> is a search engine for academic publications, and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> has been having fun with it.
</p><p>Randall searches for various terms that are composed of some common prefixes and common suffixes, but not always commonly associated with each other in each possible combination, and tabulates the results. See this <a href="#Table_with_numbers">table with numbers</a> for easy overview.
</p><p>This reveals some very commonly used full terms like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_Physics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Theoretical Physics">Theoretical Physics</a>", the most discovered, which represents almost four million hits compared to the next highest, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_Biology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Computational Biology">Computational Biology</a>", with almost 3 million hits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Astrophysics">Astrophysics</a> with 2 million hits. Ducking just below 1 million hits is fourth placing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Biology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Marine Biology">Marine Biology</a>. Of the 42 possible fields just 14 have more than 100,000 hits, and only four more have over 10,000.
</p><p>But there are also some that have much lower numbers, eight with fewer than 10 hits in the table. "High-Energy Psychology" and "Marine Dentistry" have just one apparent occurrence each (equivalent to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Googlewhack">Googlewhack</a>), whilst there are no hits at all recorded for four of the initially combined terms. In total (with the title text) there are 48 fields, see a full <a href="#List_of_Scientific_fields">list of scientific fields</a> below.
</p><p>An explanation for both existing and fictive scientific fields can be given below in the <a href="#Table_with_explanations">table with explanations</a>.
</p><p>In the caption to the table Randall list four potential research opportunities i.e. those with no hits in the table: Quantum Dentistry, High-Energy Dentistry, Astrodentistry, and High-Energy Theology
</p><p>He thus suggests that, because of the (apparent) lack of current studies in these specialized sub-fields, there may be unexplored potential for a study. This could be that the more "used" areas have far too much competition and be might  already be "used up" for potentially useful discoveries. (This does not account for how much 'study space' might be available in a given box of research, even though Randall has previously hinted that anything "Astro"-related is potentially <a href="/wiki/index.php/2640:_The_Universe_by_Scientific_Field" title="2640: The Universe by Scientific Field">full of many things to study</a>.)
Of course the real reason for no one studying these fields are that they make no sense. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dentistry">Dentistry</a> is related to fixing peoples teeth. The quantum world has no effect on human teeth<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, and high-energy bombardment of a human's mouth may also be a bit dangerous (although x-rays and radiation treatment in the mouth could be seen as high energy). Astrodentistry is not really relevant if seeing this as something used on humans. Of course astronauts might need dentistry while in space, but it would be a stretch to call the study of dentistry in zero-G, "astrodentistry". "High-energy Theology" as a term, seems more likely to have been used...
</p><p>In the title text Randall lists the figures for another 'major' field suffix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Massage">Massage</a>, and the numbers of its prefixed forms. From this, we learn that Astromassage is another 'open' field that is currently unstudied, but none of the five others have more than 10. Probably the most surprising aspect of the title text is that there are hits for both quantum massage and high-energy massage.

<td> 'Theoretical engineering' is a term that can be applied to many different types of engineering. A few that can be found on the front page, as of the time of writing, are software engineering, mobile engineering, band engineering and engineering optimisation. The term itself simply talks about the theory to do with those types of engineering.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Theoretical Theology
</td>
<td> 726
</td>
<td> Theoretical Theology is a bit of a misnomer, considering that Theology is theoretical from the outset. Theoretical Theology would hence be equivalent to Theology, that is, the systematic study of divine nature and religion in general. Unless, perhaps, it concerns itself with questions of how any given theology would have to be under differing conditions, e.g. how a society would interact under the aegis of different moralities or deitic purposes than those currently understood to exist by that society.

<tr>
<td> Theoretical Dentistry
</td>
<td> 41
</td>
<td> While there is theory in dentistry, as with all other sciences, there is no branch of dentistry specifically concerning it<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Theoretical Massage
</td>
<td> 10
</td>
<td> Theoretical Massage is not a real scientific field<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, but rather the theory about it, in contrast to the practical application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Massage">massage</a>. This term is most likely to be used in the context of learning or studying massages, for example during the process of becoming a massage therapist. Alternatively this term could refer to the studying of the masses of matter, (or its massage if you will). This would make it a field of physics.

<td> Quantum engineering is the engineering of technology that uses the laws of quantum mechanics for their operation. It is used in the manufacture of quantum sensors and quantum computers. An emerging field, it is slowly growing alongside the current rise in quantum applications in technology and the push towards quantum computing.

<dl><dd>Theoretical theology returns 1.6 million results, so the comic is wrong, and high energy theology is wrong as well,  searching on these three terms results in 602,000 results, not 0.  I think perhaps Scholar.google.com has detected your skepticism, and is returning incorrect results for you, in accordance with the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Theology, in which God only exists for those who are not atheists.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Seebert&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Seebert (page does not exist)">Seebert</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Seebert&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Seebert (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:29, 9 August 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>"high energy theology" in quotes returns zero. "theoretical theology" actually returns 726 results, as in the comic. Searching without quotes is a double-edged sword: On one hand it would get results in which the terms are mentioned in separate sentences, and thus aren't relevant to the (non-existant<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>) scientific field called "high energy theology". On the other it would get results about fields similar to what one would imagine these combinations would describe. For example there's only one result for "marine dentistry", but there's several articles on dentistry on sea mammals, which would use both "marine" and "dentistry" in the same article.

<p>Unfortunately the "Marine dentistry" one appear to be a false positive: it contains the test string "...Marine, Dentistry..." in a list of possible fields where AR technology could be useful (Novakova, N.G., 2019.

<dl><dd>Because sadly after ParL did their nitpicking, nobody else felt qualified to actually explain the joke <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:256.256.256.256" title="User:256.256.256.256"><font color="800080">256.256.256.256</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:256.256.256.256" title="User talk:256.256.256.256"><font color="0000FF">talk about me behind my back</font></a>)  10:09, 9 August 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I worked on giving actually competent editors a base to modify, but then someone else had already made an explanation. Here's my attempt:
</p><p>"Within each branch of science, like physics, chemistry or biology, there are different scientific fields. Some of the prefixes, like theoretical, quantum or astro-, are used across multiple branches of science. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Quantum mechanics">quantum physics</a> is about the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Quantum chemistry">Quantum chemistry</a> is about the application of quantum mechanics to chemical systems.
</p><p>Randall combines a bunch of different <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Scientific Field Prefixes</a> with another bunch of scientific branches, creating combinations that form several real fields of science, but also nonsense ones. To get a grasp on whether that scientific field is real and/or well-known, he searches for the combinations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, a web search engine that indexes the contents of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines, counting the number of results for each combination. Some term combinations are common, and can thus be assumed to be real scientific fields, while others are uncommon, suggesting that those fields are not well known. Four combinations are not found even once, suggesting that they are "potential research opportunities", as the title text says.
</p><p>There are problems with Randall's method though:"
</p><p>Maybe some of this may be useful, I don't know <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:256.256.256.256" title="User:256.256.256.256"><font color="800080">256.256.256.256</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:256.256.256.256" title="User talk:256.256.256.256"><font color="0000FF">talk about me behind my back</font></a>)  11:21, 9 August 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd><i>Ah, that was me. Apologies. And you ECed the following attempt to post into here, so hete it is repasted.&#160;;) Still applies. Your contribution also clearly appreciated...</i></dd>
<dd>I hated it so much, I rewrote it ("/* Explanation */ Nixing the downer 'explanation'. Perhaps some points can be extracted from it, even as my attempt is improved or (in turn) overwritten with something better."). Was going to suggest a table of prefixes/suffixes to describe each, but someone added the (sortable) tables in for the full forms (caused me much edit-conflict pain, hope I didn't cause someone else ECs in return) so maybe that's overkill. But "what exactly is 'Astro-Dentistry'?", etc, might be a useful addition in there, if it doesn't make the table(s) hard to read... <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.162.155" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.162.155">172.70.162.155</a> 11:28, 9 August 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd><i>Postscript to above</i>: Yes, your explanation does things that I was going to do if I hadn't had my first attempt to nix/rewrite hit the table-adding. i.e. go into the major-suffix/minor-prefix sets, or even whole-term where it exists, and spell out and wikilink accordingly. I would be honoured to see your blocked text integrated into mine (or satisfied with yours going there again with barely a smidgen of mine still remaining). Up to you/the others, though, as I'm not wanting to add further ECs to the rush...&#160;;) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.13" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.13">172.70.85.13</a> 11:35, 9 August 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I like that idea, maybe as an additional table? I can imagine it would take up a whole screen so maybe putting it at the end of the page could help so those that don't need it don't have to scroll over it. I don't feel capable enough to make such a big table (especially with 48 explanations) but I do support that idea. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:256.256.256.256" title="User:256.256.256.256"><font color="800080">256.256.256.256</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:256.256.256.256" title="User talk:256.256.256.256"><font color="0000FF">talk about me behind my back</font></a>)  11:36, 9 August 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I have added all three tables now. Both with plain numbers, for explanation and the one in the transcript (which should not be sort-able and not include massage!) Feel free to fill out the table. I have put it in a new section so editing that section or the explanation section does not edit conflict! --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 11:52, 9 August 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>It feels like the current explanation is rather burying the core of the joke, which is about research students deliberately selecting topics in the most obscure sub-fields they can find (which are probably unstudied for a reason), more for the fact that it gives them more opportunity to produce something novel than to add something useful to the body of knowledge. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.85.221" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.85.221">172.70.85.221</a> 08:15, 10 August 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>High energy magic is definitely a legitimate scientific subject, see for example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wiki.lspace.org/High_Energy_Magic_Building">https://wiki.lspace.org/High_Energy_Magic_Building</a>

</p><p>Worth noting is that all these prefixes are those found commonly on physics and chemistry! Would you find "cosmetic physics", "veterinary physics", "paediatric physics" and so on... which are probably as common in medical field as "high-energy" or "quantum" might be in physics/chemistry. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.146.41" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.146.41">162.158.146.41</a> 15:47, 9 August 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Interestingly enough, "pediatric physics" gets hits.

<p>Considering some of the pseudoscientific woo that my late mother-in-law believed in, and the shelves of books of "healing energy" babble she had, I'm not in the least surprised that there are hits on "quantum massage". Quantum <i>anything</i> is going to pop up eventually. There were books about homeopathic colour, and about magic trampolining. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:BunsenH" title="User:BunsenH">BunsenH</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:BunsenH" title="User talk:BunsenH">talk</a>) 15:57, 9 August 2022 (UTC)

</p><p>Randall missed some even more interesting prefixes here. Such as: "forensic", "structural",
"poststructural", "civil", "Biblical", "feminist", "postcolonial", "pediatric".

<p>Given that multipie editors have reported differing results, one <i>or more</i> people need to double-check them on Scholar, Books Ngrams, and Trends for both web and news, and combine it all into a database that users can click through to some Pandas and plotting code on Colab for analysis and visualization. Maybe if I have time later. I'm thinking of using, e.g., a CSV embedded in a Colab notebook, but it would be great if those services don't require any API keys so everyone can generate and examine the results from their respective locales. 
</p><p>Also, is there a way we can work the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Simulation hypothesis">simulation hypothesis</a> into high-energy theology? I'm on the fence about that last one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.214.105" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.214.105">172.70.214.105</a> 21:05, 9 August 2022 (UTC)
