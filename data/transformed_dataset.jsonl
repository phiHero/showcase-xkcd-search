So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a \"survivor.\" But your odds are still 60%. They can't scan for individual cancer cells. The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere. If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%. And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.

We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out before us.

We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us. Cueball: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.

{"id":"802","title":"Online Communities 2","transcript":"Map of Online Communities\nSize on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the Spring and Summer of 2010.  [The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is \"Facebook\" - with large states in the south-east of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea. A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger. The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel. In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online. To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd. East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.) To the southwest of Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]   ABOUT THIS MAP\nCommunities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing, sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some comparing of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent. Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up). Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wikipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.

{"id":"1227","title":"The Pace of Modern Life","transcript":"The art of letter-writing is fast dying out. When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence ... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.\nThe Sunday Magazine\n1871 It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. In olden times it was different.\nThe Medical Record\n1884 With the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... The dreamy quiet old days are over... For men now live think and work at express speed. They have their Mercury or Post laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be sulkily read as they travel ... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them... The hurry and bustle of modern life ... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease... Ancient and Modern\n1886 Conversation is said to be a lost art ... Good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.\nFrank Leslie's popular Monthly, Volume 29\n1890 Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced a craving for literary nips. The torpid brain ... has grown too weak for sustained thought.\nThere never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly.\nIsrael Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club\n1891 The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance, the days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone.\nJournal of the Institute of Jamaica, Volume 1\n1892 So much is exhibited to the eye that nothing is left to the imagination. It sometimes seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that have been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary.\nThe articles in the Quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but thirty pages is now too much so we witness a further condensing process and, we have the Fortnightly and the Contemporary which reduce thirty pages to fifteen pages so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are further condensed by the daily papers, which will give you a summary of the summary of all that has been written about everything.\nThose who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works.\nEphemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past ... hurried reading can never be good reading.\nG. J. Goschen, First Annual Address to the Students, Toynbee Hall. London\n1894 The existence of mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon ... the mania for stimulants ... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... This intellectual condition is characterized by a brain incapable of normal working ... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life, with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe...\nThe Churchman, Volume 71\n1895 If we teach the children how to play and encourage them in their sports ... instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms, the next generation will be more joyous and will be healthier than the present one. A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, Volume 18\n1895 The cause of the ... increase in nervous disease is increased demand made by the conditions of modern life upon the brain. Everything is done in a hurry. We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... We take even our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play ... what wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear.\nG. Shrady (from P.C. Knapp)\n\"Are nervous diseases increasing?\" Medical Record\n1896 The managers of sensational newspapers ... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.\nMedical Brief, Volume 26\n1898 To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible on account of the demands on our time made by our business... We act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for a car returning ...\nLouis John Rettger. Studies in Advanced Physiology\n1898 In these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr. Long Walk?\nI am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail-bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars .... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat.\nT. Thatcher, \"A plea for a long walk\",\nThe Publishers Circular\n1902 The art of conversation is almost a lost one. People talk as they ride bicycles–at a rush–without pausing to consider their surroundings ... what has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. The profession of letters is so little understood, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that ... Newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies.\nMarie Corelli,\nFree opinions, freely expressed\n1905 There is a great tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent. But against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights ... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future.\nRev. Henry Hussmann,\nThe authority of parents\n1906 Our modern family gathering, silent around the fire, each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school ...\nThe Journal of Education, Volume 29\n1907 Plays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago... The current representations of nude men and women in the daily journals and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced ... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...\nEditorial, The Watchman, Boston\n1908 We write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring ... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details. But a fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day.\nForrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence\n1908 A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a letter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week–a \"line\" now by another to-morrow.\nPercy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition\n1915 ","altTitle":"'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ...

In event astronauts stranded on Moon\nFate has ordained that the men who went to the Moon to explore in peace will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.\nOthers will follow, and surely find their way home. Man’s search will not be denied.

Hornet, crushing Nixon Tonight, we have experienced a great national triumph and a great national loss. We take joy in the safe return from the Moon of Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but that joy is tempered with sorrow as we mourn our president’s tragic death beneath their wayward capsule.\nRichard Nixon wholeheartedly supported our courageous astronauts as they carried the hopes and prayers of Earth to the heavens, and in the moment of their homecoming, he himself has departed on that ultimate voyage.

The intermediate events co-related, like the defeat of Roscoe Conkling, will be of great interest, but will scarcely be likely to stand prominently out from the page of history written in 1881. To us who have been the witnesses, so to speak, of the tragic incidents of the times, it seems entirely probable that future generations will eagerly scan every feature of the recent bereavement which the nation has suffered. How accurately will future generations know the immense volume of grief and sorrow which has rolled over the land? Will those who come after us ever be able to understand the extent of our loss? Is there anything in the first century of our history—even the death of the great Lincoln—which can be used as a parallel? Perhaps a careful reading of the daily papers of the present. period may give some future antiquarian a fine idea of the feelings of the nation during the past summer.

Popular approval of interracial marriage is below 10% in the late 1950s, rising steadily to approximately 40% in 1980, then continuing to rise more slowly to the majority approval point in 1995, and spiking up to about 65% ca. 1997, plateauing until ca. 2003, rising quickly again to about 75% ca. 2006 and rising generally upward to the final ca. 2014 statistic depicted between 85% and 90% popular approval. The visual effect seems to be a wide gap of time between legalization of and popular approval of interracial marriage. Popular approval appears to trail legalization by no less than 20 years at any given point. Popular approval of same-sex marriage (according to \"various polls\") is depicted first at about 15% ca. 1986, trending gradually upward until ca. 2000, where it plateaus between 35% and 40% to resume an upward trend ca. 2007, continuing steadily through majority approval in 2011 to a ca. 2014 value between 55% and 60%. The legality of same-sex marriage is indicated to start at 0% ca. 2002, then jumps quickly to plateau around 5% until ca. 2008, at which point it spikes up to between 15% and 20%, then plummets to just above than 5% by ca. 2009, jumping quickly back up to between 15% and 20% between ca. 2010 and 2011, then trending upward even more quickly to end at about 55% legality ca. 2014. The visual effect seems to be a more turbulent line for legality of same-sex marriage than any of the other trends, which also seems to be quickly closing on the popular approval trend. Popular approval has preceded legalization by nearly 20 years at certain points, but the trends appear to be closing and may intersect by 2015 or 2016.] ","altTitle":"People often say that same-sex marriage now is like interracial marriage in the 60s.

{"id":"1126","title":"Epsilon and Zeta","transcript":"THE SAGA OF EPSILON AND ZETA\nThe 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how strange the season got toward the end.\nThe forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.\nTheir predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic — far from any land — the atmosphere stopped making sense.\nAnd the forecasters — who'd expected the season to be long over by now — started to get a little...unhinged.\nThis is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories: Tropical Storm Epsilon ... The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr. 4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours. Epsilon does not appear weaker. 10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane. Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds ...can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable. Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane ... but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday. 4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm. :10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened. There are no clear reasons ... and I am not going to make one up ... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts. However ... I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening ... Epsilon will likely become a remnant low. I heard that before about epsilon ... haven't you? The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude in December. We have said this before ... but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon. I have run out of things to say. The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime ... Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status. 4 AM Wed: The end is in sight ... yes ... but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane. Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds. I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season. NOPE. Enter Tropical Storm Zeta. An elongated area of low pressure ... which had its origins in an old frontal trough ... began developing organized convection overnight. Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005. Any new storms would be in the 2006 season. Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam ... the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them. But 2005's wouldn't end until Zeta did. Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago ... but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again. This is like Epsilon all over again. Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now ... well ... zeta is pretty much alive at this time. I have no choice but to forecast weakening again and again. By 24-36 hours ... a significant increase in westerly winds ... should act to shear away most of the associated convection ... and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending. 4 PM Mon: It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment. therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening. Zeta is stronger than yesterday. As you can see... I ran out of things to say. Satellite intensity estimates have decreased. Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression. Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued ... regretfully ... the intensity ... increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again. Although it seems as if Zeta will never die ... the forecast continues to show weakening. Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone... which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended. This is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005.  Actually, Zeta's cloud pattern is... (out of panel) NO. Ok.

The top left room is 'The Hall of Misunderstood Science'. It contains six exhibits. Exhibit: A giant basilisk looms over children. BASILISKS: Real, deadly, under your bed. Exhibit: Four magnets hang from a square arch. A child is touching two of them together. Magnets only leap at each other when they're teenagers. Later, they lose interest. Exhibit: A child on his dad's shoulders looks up at a looming statue of Jesus behind a lectern. There are flakes falling from Jesus onto them both. Snow is Jesus' dandruff. His scalp gets dry when it's cold. Exhibit: A child lies asleep, while hands and a scary face reach up around the bed toward him. Sleep: Now you're vulnerable to the boogie man! Exhibit: An ice block sits on a stand in front of pictures of a wolf and rhinoceros looking frightened. Freezing water: Expands to frighten predators. Exhibit: An insect on a stick is orbited by a small sphere. Anti-matter: Matter that is more than 50% ants. Exhibit: A DNA strand with the letters T, A, C, and G hanging around it. DNA only has four letters because the alphabet was smaller back then. Told you so. Exhibit: A bunch of molecules hang from the ceiling. Molecules? In my day, we only had atoms! The top right room is 'Regrettable Pranks: An Interactive Experience'. There are four exhibits. Exhibit: Five balloons float tethered to a table. A child is holding a sixth balloon. The Dad looks alarmed. If this helium makes your voice go higher, it's because you're ten seconds from exploding. Exhibit: An alien face is shown above an outline of several hands next to a ruler. A child holds his hand up to it. Measure your middle finger. If it's longer than the others, you're an alien halfbreed. Exhibit: Three cups are on a table. A child is walking away with a fourth cup, the dad's arm around the child's shoulder. Has anyone seen my rabbit brain? It looks like a cherry, and I dropped it in a Jello cup. Exhibit: A monstrous set of jaws open upward around a bed. Make your bed or monsters will know a kid lives there. The center right room is 'Concessions'. There are three booths. Booth: A concession stand is labeled 'KFP', and displays a KFC-style bucket. A dad and child are eating. The \"P\" is for \"phoenix\". Booth: A concession stand. Ground beef: Beef we found on the ground. Told you. Booth: A stand shaped like a giant eye. EYES CREAM How did you think it was spelled? Now with more of the goo in your eyes. Same as every other creamery. The lower left room is 'Conservatory of Poorly Remembered History'. There are five exhibits. Exhibit: A man is riding a dragon. Genghis Khan: victory through dragons. Exhibit: A criminal in front of some windows. The Crimean War: The first war against crime. Exhibit: A castle with flags hanging on it. The Renaissance Long story short, the wizards were in control. Exhibit:A man in Jedi-style robes with a fake beard. Star Wars is a documentary. No, seriously. Kids, this man is a veteran. The lower right room is 'Rotunda of Uncomfortable Topics'. There are five exhibits. Exhibit: A wrestling ring, with a man and woman mostly obscured by the exhibit label. Naked wrestling: perfectly normal. NEVER DO IT. Exhibit: a figure sits at a booth in front of a bowl of food. The dad is holding a bottle. Alcohol is poison. I drink to save you from it. You're welcome. Exhibit: A large bird. Mommies get big tummies before babies come because the stork likes chubby girls. Exhibit: A rocket ship. Grandma's not dead. She just returned to Saturn. For REVENGE. In the areas outside the rooms, there are two more exhibits and restrooms, all clickable. Exhibit: A dinosaur skeleton. That's right. Dinosaurs were made entirely of BONES. If you think about it, it makes sense. Exhibit: A large image hangs on the wall. It is a dense squiggly jumble of lines. You gotta squint juuust right. Magic eye trick that doesn't actually work.

Each quote is followed by the author, the document of publication if applicable, and the year.) Notes from the past It's desirable every thing printed should be preserved, for we cannot now tell how useful it may become two centuries hence.\nChristopher Baldwin\n1834 I predict that a century hence the Canadian people will be the noblest specimens of humanity on the face of the earth\nRev. John Bredin\n1863 In the twenty-first century mankind will subsist entirely upon jellies.\nThe Booklover\n1903 The twenty-first century baby is destined to be rocked and cradled by electricity, warmed and coddled by electricity, perhaps fathered and mothered by electricity. Probably the only thing he will be left to do unaided will be to make love.\nMrs. John Lane, The fortnightly\n1905 To-day, in the city of New York, sixty-six different tongues are spoken. A century hence, there will probably be only one.\nThe American Historical Magazine\n1907 I often think what interesting history we are making for the student of the twenty-first century.\nWillian Carey Jones\n1908 China may be a great shoe market a decade or a century from now.\nBoot and Shoe Recorder\n1914 We cannot settle the problem, and I venture the prophecy that perhaps a century from now this same question may be brought before some future society and discussed very much as it is tonight.\nDr. Barton C.

Sand and rocks stretch to infinity.\nAs best as I can tell. There's plenty of time for thinking out here.\nAn eternity really. I've rederived modern math in the sand\nand then some. Physics too. I worked out the kinks in quantum mechanics and relativity.\nTook a lot of thinking, but this place has fewer distractions than a Swiss patent office. One day I started laying down rows of rocks. Each new row followed from the last in a simple pattern. With the right set of rules and enough space, I was able to build a computer.\nEach new row of stones is the next iteration of the computation. Sure it's rocks instead of electricity, but it's the same* thing. Just slower.\n*Turing-complete After a while, I programmed it to be a physics simulator. Every piece of information about a particle was encoded as a string of bits written in the stones.\n00101010\n00101010 With enough time and space, I could fully simulate two particles interacting. But I have infinite time and space. So I decided to simulate a universe. The eons blur past as I walk down a single row. The rows blur past to compute a single step. And in the simulation... another instant ticks by. So if you see a mote of dust vanish from your vision in a little flash or something I'm sorry.
